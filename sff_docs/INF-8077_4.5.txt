Abstract: This speciﬁcation deﬁnes the electrical, management, and mechanical interfaces of the XFP module. The
module is a hot pluggable small footprint serial-to-serial data-agnostic multirate optical transceiver, intended to
support Telecom (SONET OC-192 and G.709 “OTU-2”) and Datacom applications (10 Gb/s Ethernet and 10 Gb/s
Fibre Channel). Nominal data rates range from 9.95 Gb/s, 10.31 Gb/s, 10.52 Gb/s, 10.70 Gb/s, and the emerging
11.09 Gb/s. The modules support all data encodings for these technologies. The modules may be used to imple-
ment single mode or multi-mode serial optical interfaces at 850 nm, 1310 nm, or 1550 nm. The XFP module design
may use one of several different optical connectors. An adaptable heatsink option allows a single module design to
be compatible with a variety of hosts.

Support: This document was adopted by the XFP MSA and is provided to the SFF for distribution and as a source
document for related SFF projects.

Documentation: This document has been prepared according to the guidelines and agreements of the XFP MSA.
The XFP MSA has the stated intention of encouraging broad and rapid industry adoption of the speciﬁcation. The
XFP speciﬁcation and the technologies it uses may be offered to formal standards bodies to further support the
adoption of the speciﬁcation.

                                          SFF Committee information

If you are not a member of the SFF Committee, but you are interested in participating, the following principles have
been reprinted here for your information.



PRINCIPLES OF THE SFF COMMITTEE

The SFF Committee is an ad hoc group formed to address storage industry needs in a prompt manner. When
formed in 1990, the original goals were limited to deﬁning de facto mechanical envelopes within which disk drives
can be developed to ﬁt compact computer and other small products.

In November 1992, the SFF Committee objectives were broadened to encompass other areas which needed simi-
lar attention, such as pinouts for interface applications, and form factor issues on larger disk drives. SFF is a forum
for resolving industry issues that are either not addressed by the standards process or need an immediate solution.

Documents created by the SFF Committee are expected to be submitted to bodies such as EIA (Electronic Indus-
tries Association) or an ANSI Accredited Standards Committee. They may be accepted for separate standards, or
incorporated into other standards activities.

The principles of operation for the SFF Committee are not unlike those of an accredited standards committee.
There are 3 levels of participation:

      - Attending the meetings is open to all, but taking part in discussions is limited to member companies, or
     those invited by member companies
      - The minutes and copies of material which are discussed during meetings are distributed only to those who
     sign up to receive documentation.
      - The individuals who represent member companies of the SFF Committee receive documentation and vote
     on issues that arise. Votes are not taken during meetings, only guidance on directions. All voting is by letter
     ballot, which ensures all members an equal opportunity to be heard.

Material presented at SFF Committee meetings becomes public domain. There are no restrictions on the open
mailing of material presented at committee meetings. In order to reduce disagreements and misunderstandings,
copies must be provided for all agenda items that are discussed. Copies of the material presented, or revisions if
completed in time, are included in the documentation mailings.

The sites for SFF Committee meetings rotate based on which member companies volunteer to host the meetings.
Meetings have typically been held during the INCITS T10 weeks. The meetings of the SFF Special Subject Work-
ing Group on Transceivers have typically been held during INCITS T11 weeks.

The funds received from the annual membership fees are placed in escrow, and are used to reimburse ENDL for
the services to manage the SFF Committee.

Foreword for SFF documents

When 2 1/2" diameter disk drives were introduced, there was no commonality on external dimensions e.g. physical
size, mounting locations, connector type, connector location, between vendors.

The ﬁrst use of these disk drives was in speciﬁc applications such as laptop portable computers in which space
was at a premium and time to market with the latest machine was an important factor. System integrators worked
individually with vendors to develop the packaging. The result was wide diversity, and with space being such a
major consideration in packaging, it was not possible to replace one vendor's drive with a competitive product.

The desire to reduce disk drive sizes to even smaller dimensions such as 1.8" and 1.3" made it likely that devices
would become even more constrained in dimensions because of a possibility that such small devices could be
inserted into a socket, not unlike the method of retaining semiconductor devices.

The problems faced by integrators, device suppliers, and component suppliers led to the formation of an industry
ad hoc group to address the marketing and engineering considerations of the emerging new technology in disk
drives. After two informal gatherings on the subject in the summer of 1990, the SFF Committee held its ﬁrst meet-
ing in August.

During the development of the form factor deﬁnitions, other activities were suggested because participants in the
SFF Committee faced problems other than the physical form factors of disk drives. In November 1992, the mem-
bers approved an expansion in charter to address any issues of general interest and concern to the storage indus-
try. The SFF Committee became a forum for resolving industry issues that are either not addressed by the
standards process or need an immediate solution.

At the same time, the principle was adopted of restricting the scope of an SFF project to a narrow area, so that the
majority of documents would be small and the projects could be completed in a rapid timeframe. If proposals are
made by a number of contributors, the participating members select the best concepts and uses them to develop
speciﬁcations which address speciﬁc issues in emerging storage markets.

Those companies which have agreed to support a documented speciﬁcation are identiﬁed in the ﬁrst pages of each
SFF Speciﬁcation. Industry consensus is not an essential requirement to publish an SFF Speciﬁcation because it is
recognized that in an emerging product area, there is room for more than one approach. By making the documen-
tation on competing proposals available, an integrator can examine the alternatives available and select the prod-
uct that is felt to be most suitable.

Suggestions for improvement of this document will be welcome. They should be sent to the SFF Committee, 14426
Black Walnut Ct, Saratoga, CA 95070. The suggestions should additionally be sent to the XFP Chair and Technical
Editor.

The development work on this speciﬁcation was done by the XFP Group, an industry MSA.

SFF Speciﬁcations

There are several projects active within the SFF Committee. At the date of printing, document numbers had been
assigned to the following projects. The status of Speciﬁcations is dependent on committee activities.

F = Forwarded          The document has been approved by the members for forwarding to a formal standards
                       body.

P = Published          The document has been balloted by members and is available as a published SFF Speci-
                       ﬁcation.

A = Approved           The document has been approved by ballot of the members and is in preparation as an
                       SFF Speciﬁcation.
C = Canceled           The project was canceled, and no Speciﬁcation was Published.

D = Development        The document is under development at SFF.

E = Expired            The document has been published as an SFF Speciﬁcation, and the members voted
                       against re-publishing it when it came up for annual review.

e = electronic         Used as a sufﬁx to indicate an SFF Speciﬁcation which has Expired but is still available in
                       electronic form from SFF e.g. a speciﬁcation has been incorporated into a draft or pub-
                       lished standard which is only available in hard copy.

i = Information        The document has no SFF project activity in progress, but it deﬁnes features in developing
                       industry standards. The document was provided by a company, editor of an accredited
                       standard in development, or an individual. It is provided for broad review (comments to the
                       author are encouraged).

s = submitted The document is a proposal to the members for consideration to become an SFF Speciﬁcation.

                                       XFP Foreword

The XFP Promoters, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Ciena Cor-
poration, Emulex Corporation, Finisar Corporation, Innovation Core SEI, Inc. (a Sumitomo Electric
Company), JDS Uniphase Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Tyco Electronics Corporation,
Velio Communication, and many contributors gathered together to develop a speciﬁcation for a 10
Gigabit small foot print pluggable module. The Promoters stated a wish to encourage broad and
rapid industry adoption of the speciﬁcation. The XFP speciﬁcation may be offered to formal stan-
dards bodies to further support the adoption of the speciﬁcation. The XFP Promoters and Contrib-
utors solicited technical review and contributions to the XFP speciﬁcation among many component,
module, and system designers and manufacturers to assure that it meets a broad variety of re-
quirements.

Signed agreements exist among the promoters and between the promoters and contributors that
allowed them to carry forward these activities in a manner that encouraged rapid development,
open sharing of technology, and the timely resolution of disagreements. The agreements further
explained and protected the rights of both promoters and contributors. Similar agreements protect
the rights of adopters of the speciﬁcation.

Organizations may become adopters of the XFP speciﬁcation by contacting any XFP Promoter and
requesting the necessary forms and following the required procedures.

                        terfaces of the XFP module. The module is a hot pluggable small footprint 8
                        serial-to-serial data-agnostic multirate optical transceiver, intended to
                                                                                                   9
                        support Telecom (SONET OC-192 and G.709 “OTU-2”) and Datacom ap-
                        plications (10 Gb/s Ethernet and 10 Gb/s Fibre Channel). Nominal data 10
                        rates range from 9.95 Gb/s, 10.31 Gb/s, 10.52 Gb/s, 10.70 Gb/s, and the 11
                        emerging 11.09 Gb/s. The modules support all data encodings for these 12
                        technologies. The modules may be used to implement single mode or          13
                        multi-mode serial optical interfaces at 850 nm, 1310 nm, or 1550 nm. The 14
                        XFP module design may use one of several different optical connectors
                                                                                                   15
                        5.17. An adaptable heatsink option allows a single module design to be
                        compatible with a variety of hosts.                                        16

2.4.7.3 MODULE BEHAVIOR DURING POWER DOWN AND RESET                                                        1
                            During execution of a reset (t_init) or while held in Power Down mode, a 2
                            module may be unable to determine the correct value for Mod_NR and             3
                            RX_LOS. These outputs as well as all interrupt related ﬂags, except com- 4
                            pletion of Reset ﬂag, shall be disregarded by the host. When the module 5
                            completes a Reset and is not in Power Down mode, the module must rep-
                                                                                                           6
                            resent the correct value of both signals on its outputs before posting a
                            completion of reset interrupt to the host (see Table 39, bit 0 register ad- 7
                            dress 84).                                                                     8
                                                                                                           9
                            At no time shall a module cause spurious assertion of the Interrupt pin. 10
                                                                                                           11
                            When a host initially applies power to a module with the P_Down/RST            12
                            signal asserted, a module comes up in power down mode. The module
                                                                                                           13
                            shall only assert the Interrupt signal pin to inform the host it has completed
                            a reset. The completion of reset ﬂag (see Table 39, bit 0 register address 14
                            84) shall be the only interrupt source ﬂag set during power down mode. 15
                            The host is expected to clear this interrupt before releasing the module       16
                            from the power down mode. The transition from power down mode to               17
                            normal mode will trigger a reset of the module and result in a 2nd module 18
                            reset and a 2nd reset completion interrupt to the host
                                                                                                           19

 1. Modules which present a small capacitive load to the host during hotplug ( C ≤ 300nF ) are exempt from the inrush current requirements
 since they limit the total in rush charge.

                          Serial Clock (SCL): The host supplied SCL input to XFP transceivers is 2
                          used to positively edge clock data into each XFP device and negative        3
                          clock data out of each device. The SCL line may be pulled low by an XFP 4
                          module during clock stretching.                                             5
                                                                                                      6
                          Serial Data (SDA): The SDA pin is bi-directional for serial data transfer.
                                                                                                      7
                          This pin is open-drain or open-collector driven and may be wire-ORed
                          with any number of open-drain or open collector devices.                    8
                                                                                                      9
                          Master/Slave: XFP transceivers operate only as slave devices. The host 10
                          must provide a bus master for SCL and initiate all read/write communica- 11
                          tion.                                                                       12

                          Device Address: Each XFP is hard wired at the device address A0h. See
                          XFP MSA Chapter 5: Management interface for memory structure within 14
                          each transceiver.                                                           15
                                                                                                      16
                          Multiple Devices per SCL/SDA: While XFP transceivers are compatible 17
                          with point-to-point SCL/SDA, they can also be paralleled on a single        18
                          SCL/SDA bus by using the XFP Mod_DeSel line. See section 2.4.2 and 19
                          Table 26 for more information.
                                                                                                      20
                          Clock and Data Transitions: The SDA pin is normally pulled high with an 21
                          external device. Data on the SDA pin may change only during SCL low         22
                          time periods. Data changes during SCL high periods indicate a START or 23
                          STOP condition. All addresses and data words are serially transmitted to 24
                          and from the XFP in 8-bit words. Every byte on the SDA line must be 8- 25
                          bits long. Data is transferred with the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) ﬁrst.
                                                                                                      26
                          START Condition: A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high is a         27
                          START condition, which must precede any other command.                      28
                                                                                                      29
                          STOP Condition: A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a          30
                          STOP condition.                                                             31

                          Acknowledge: After sending each 8-bit word, the transmitter releases the
                                                                                                      33
                          SDA line for one bit time, during which the receiver is allowed to pull SDA
                          low (zero) to acknowledge (ACK) that it has received each word. Device 34

                          for which the host shall respond with a STOP instead of an ACK.             38

                           In addition to the basic I2C read/write functionality, all XFP modules shall
                           support packet error checking deﬁned in the sections below. The packet 28
                           error checking system may be enabled or disabled by the host system,           29
                           and will default to being disabled on power-up or reset. Packet error          30
                           checking allows the host system to conﬁrm the validity of any read data 31
                           including the address from which the read originated. Packet error             32
                           checking also allows the XFP module to determine the validity of write
                                                                                                          33

                           the system to determine if a write communication was successful. All           34
                           packet error checking operations involve the calculation of a CRC-8 value 35
                           by the module and host. The CRC-8 value is the cyclical redundancy             36

                           XFP devices maintain an internal data word address counter containing 40

4.5.7 WRITE OPERATIONS (BYTE WRITE)

                                           A write operation requires an 8-bit data word address following the device 28

                                           master must terminate the write sequence with a STOP condition for the 32

                                           dition (i.e. a repeated START per the I2C speciﬁcation) the write is aborted 34
                                           and the data received during that operation is discarded. Upon receipt of 35
                                           the proper STOP condition, the XFP enters an internally timed write cycle, 36

CHAPTER 5: MANAGEMENT INTERFACE                                                                      1

                      This chapter deﬁnes the operation of the XFP 2-wire serial interface which
                                                                                                     6
                      is used for serial ID, digital diagnostics, and certain control functions. The
                      2-wire serial interface is mandatory for all XFP modules. It is modeled        7
                      largely after the digital diagnostics monitoring interface proposed for the 8
                      SFP and GBIC optical transceivers and deﬁned in SFF draft document             9
                      SFF-8472 Rev 9.3, which in turn is an extension of the original serial ID 10
                      systems deﬁned for the GBIC and SFP transceivers. One major differ-            11
                      ence, however, is that the memory structure is changed to use a single 2- 12
                      wire interface address.
                                                                                                     13
                      The structure of the memory map is shown in Figure 28. The normal 256 14
                      Byte I2C address space is divided into lower and upper blocks of 128           15
                      Bytes. The lower block of 128 Bytes is always directly available and is        16
                      used for the diagnostics and control functions described in this document 17
                      that must be accessed repeatedly. One exception to this is that the stan- 18
                      dard module identiﬁer Byte deﬁned in the GBIC and SFP is located in Byte
                                                                                                     19
                      0 of the memory map (in the diagnostics space) to allow software devel-
                      oped for multiple module types to have a common branching decision             20
                      point. This Byte is repeated in the Serial ID section so that it also appears 21
                      in the expected relationship to other serial ID bits.                          22
                                                                                                     23
                      Multiple blocks of memories are available in the upper 128 Bytes of the 24
                      address space. These are individually addressed through a table select 25
                      Byte which the user enters into a location in the lower address space.
                                                                                                     26
                      Thus, there is a total available address space of 128 * 256 = 32Kbytes in
                      this upper memory space.                                                       27
                                                                                                     28
                      The upper address space tables are used for less frequently accessed           29
                      functions such as serial ID, user writable EEPROM, reserved EEPROM 30
                      and diagnostics and control spaces for future standards deﬁnition, as well 31
                      as ample space for vendor speciﬁc functions. These are allocated as fol-

                   7-4 are 0100b.                                                                   17

                   The signal conditioner may optionally support two different loopback             19
                   modes which may be useful for various diagnostics needs.                         20
                                                                                                    21
                   The ﬁrst of these modes is known as XFI Loopback. In this mode, which 22
                   is set by writing a 1 into Bit 1 of Byte 1 of the lower memory map, data
                                                                                                    23
                   input on the TX pins of the XFP module are retimed and output on the RX
                   pins of the module. Optical data is not transmitted or received when in the 24
                   XFI Loopback mode. This control bit will power up and reset to 0 resulting 25
                   in normal operation.                                                             26
                                                                                                    27
                   The second loopback mode is known as Lineside Loopback. In this mode, 28
                   which is set by writing a 1 into Bit 2 of Byte 1 of the lower memory map,
                                                                                                    29
                   data received on the XFP module receiver is retimed and output on optical
                   transmitter. This optical data is not present on the electrical interface in     30
                   this mode. This control bit will power up and reset to 0 resulting in normal 31
                   operation.                                                                       32

                   Support for these loopback modes is indicated in the serial ID memory            34
                   map in Byte 164 (CDR Support). Simultaneous operation of both loop-              35

                   When a host selects one of the optional voltage modes, power and current 1
                   requirements of the module should scale at least linearly with voltage (this 2

                   To enable the “bypassed regulator mode” the host should follow the se- 32

                   In modules that implement both optional modes the value written in Byte 39
                   58 takes precedence over the value written in Byte 59, i.e. if both of Byte 40
                   58, bits 3-0 and Byte 59, bit 0 are non-zero the module will be in “opera- 41

                          In order to allow virtually complete operation of the XFP module via the 2- 21
                          wire serial interface, a set of control and status bits are provided to mirror 22
                          the operation of key status and control pins. These are provided in Bytes 23
                          110-111 and are detailed in Table 42. All status bits except soft bits in this 24

                          There are many options for a bezel EMI gasket that functions as a seal     21
                          between the bezel and the front of the cage. The design of the bezel EMI 22
                          gasket and the materials used for the gasket are application speciﬁc. The 23
                          preferred method is to fasten the gasket to the back of the bezel with a   24
                          pressure sensitive adhesive. Assembly of the host board to the bezel will 25

                      This Appendix provides design guidelines for the high-speed electrical in- 7
                      terfaces found in XFP applications. A fundamental feature of the XFP       8

                      system (Host) printed circuit board (PCB) rather than within the optical
                      transceiver module. Figure 52 depicts a typical system block diagram of 10
                      an end-to-end electrical channel for XFP applications. The block diagram 11
                      includes a transceiver board that exists within the XFP module, a 30-pin 12
                      hot swappable connector, a host board, and a BGA package. Although         13
                      most host board designers will not have any direct control over the trans- 14

                          • Keep differential pair traces on the same side of the PCB to minimize 2
                              impedance discontinuities.                                               3

                              tween the two traces. Differences in trace lengths translate directly    5
                              into signal skew and can give rise to common mode reﬂections.            6

                          • Reduce, if not eliminate, vias to minimize impedance discontinuities.
                              Remember that vias and their clearance holes in the power/ground         9
                              planes can cause impedance discontinuities in nearby signals. Keep 10
                              vias away from traces by 10 times the trace width if possible, 2.5       11
                              times as a minimum.                                                      12
                          • Use rounded corners rather than 90 or 45-degree corners.                   13
                          • Keep signal traces far from other signals that might couple noise into 14
                              the signals. A good rule of thumb is that “far” means ten times the      15
                              width of the trace.                                                      16
                          • Do not route digital signals from other circuits across the area of the 17
                              transmitter and receiver.                                                18
                          • Do not cut up the power or ground planes in an effort to steer current 19
                              paths. This usually produces more noise, not less. Furthermore,          20
                              place vias and clearances so as to maintain the integrity of the plane. 21
                              Groups of vias spaced closely together often overlap clearances that 22
                              can form a large hole in the plane. Return currents are forced around 23
                              the holes, increasing loop area and therefore, EMI emissions.

                        Via structures allow PCB designers to route circuit traces between layers 7
                        of a multilayer board. Vias may be particularly useful to transition from the 8
                        pins of a BGA or connector down to stripline traces within a host or trans-
                                                                                                      9
                        ceiver board. The most common and inexpensive via structure is the so-
                        called through-hole via. A through-hole via is manufactured by drilling all 10
                        the way through the PCB followed by a plating process. The plating pro- 11
                        cess provides electrical continuity to top and buried traces by virtue of     12
                        signal pads located on the desired layers. Alternatives to the through-hole 13
                        via are the blind via and the back-drilled via. Although these alternatives 14
                        may provide higher performance, it is generally believed that most XFP
                                                                                                      15
                        adopters will use the lower cost through-hole via for volume manufac-
                        turing.                                                                       16

                        This section examines single-ended and differential through-hole vias for 18
                        XFI implementation. Guidelines are provided for trace routing and for par- 19

                        Figure 60 depicts a single-ended through-hole via that provides a transi-
                        tion from the top layer to the next adjacent layer in a 16-layer PCB. Only 25
                        that portion of the via between the adjacent layers is used for electrical    26
                        path. The remaining portion provides an electrically short open-circulated 27
                        transmission line stub. The additional reactance that results tends to lower 28
                        the characteristic impedance and hence causes reﬂections. A much              29
                        better approach is to route traces as shown in Figure 61. By transitioning 30

                        imizes the size of the open circulated stub and hence minimizes electrical
                        reﬂections.                                                                   32

                          This annex describes requirements for determining eyemask compliance. 7
                          Mask templates and coordinates are given in the appropriate subclauses 8
                          in clause 2.
                                                                                                        9
                          • Compliance is to be assured during system operation. However,               10
                              measurements with patterns such as PRBS23 or a valid 10GBASE-R 11
                              or 10GBASE-W or OC192c or STM-64 signal are likely to give similar 12
                              results.                                                                  13
                          • During test, both transmit and receive paths must be active to include 14
                              the effects of crosstalk. Trafﬁc in the other direction (than the one be- 15
                              ing tested) must use a asynchronous clock                                 16
                          • Compliance at higher rates can qualify for lower rates, however the         17
                              opposite is not allowed.                                                  18

                    should be generally above the tracking bandwidth of the CDR of the port 20

                    A versatile option for PJ is to employ multi-tone jitter created by a PRBS

                       Host system manufacturers can qualify modules for jitter peaking by 31
                       measuring them in the desired ﬁnal system environment. A module              32
                       under test can be placed in the target host system and the overall
                                                                                                    33
                       system optical-to-optical jitter transfer can be measured by placing the
                       system in a looptiming loopback mode (which should be below 0.1 dB 34
                       at 120 KHz or less). For further accuracy, the host system’s jitter          35
                       peaking can be separately measured and subtracted from the total             36
                       measurement to approximate the module’s total transmit and receive 37
                       path peaking which should be less than 0.06 dB below 120 kHz. This 38
                       measurement can be achieved by measuring the system’s electrical to 39
                       electrical jitter peaking by substituting a host compliance test coupon

                            A useful, but not complete measurement can be made of the module 2
                            jitter peaking directly by testing the module with the optical output       3
                            looped back using an electrical-to-electrical jitter peaking test, or by 4
                            looping the electrical output back to the transmitter input and per-        5
                            forming an optical to optical measurement. In this case a measure of 6
                            the sum of the transmit and receive path peaking is made. This should
                                                                                                        7
                            be less than 0.06 dB below 120 KHz, though this still allows for the
                            possibility that either the receive or transmit paths are greater than      8
                            0.03 dB.                                                                    9

                            It is expected that the low frequency jitter transfer characteristics of an 12
                            XFP module will be dominated by the signal conditioners in the              13
                            transmit and receive paths. While not a useful module compliance test, 14
                            a module manufacturer can determine likely module jitter peaking per- 15
                            formance by separately characterizing the performance of the signal 16
                            conditioners used in the modules under likely worst-case conditions.
                                                                                                        17
                            Such measurements should be done with the signal conditioners in a
                            test environment as similar as possible to that of the ﬁnal module.         18
                            These measurements do have the advantage that they can be used to 19
                            separately characterize the module receive and transmitter paths.           20
                                                                                                        21
                        While none of the above techniques is a perfect substitute to a direct com- 22
                        pliance test of module jitter peaking, they probably provide a reasonable
                                                                                                        23

                        The purpose of this appendix is to provide guidance to XFP module de-
                        signers in creating a standard test environment for simulation and/or ac- 20
                        tual testing. It allows for “one” initial means of communication between   21
                        module designers and system users.                                         22
                                                                                                   23

                        environments. The tests described in this appendix focus on a module’s
                        thermal performance within a deﬁned system level environment. Host         26
                        system designs will often optimize one or more of the following parame- 27
                        ters to achieve lower XFP case temperatures: module spacing, heatsink 28
                        shape/length/width/ﬁn design, and airﬂow direction/mixing.                 29
                                                                                                   30
                        The tests deﬁned in this appendix are intended to be easy to produce by 31
                        module manufacturers. For example, the number of modules on a host

                        of their module in customer speciﬁc applications that may have more or 34
                        less modules, other heat sinks, or environments.                           35
