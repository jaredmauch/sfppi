Abstract: This specification defines the low speed electrical and management
interface specifications for SFP+ (enhanced Small Formfactor Pluggable) modules and
hosts. The SFP+ module is a hot pluggable small footprint serial-to-serial data-
agnostic optical transceiver.

This specification provides a common reference for systems manufacturers, system
integrators, and suppliers. This is an internal working specification of the SFF
Committee, an industry ad hoc group.

This specification is made available for public review, and written comments are
solicited from readers. Comments received by the members will be considered for
inclusion in future revisions of this specification.

Support: This specification is supported by the identified member companies of the
SFF Committee.

Foreword

The development work on this specification was done by the SFF Committee, an
industry group. The membership of the committee since its formation in August 1990
has included a mix of companies which are leaders across the industry.

When 2 1/2" diameter disk drives were introduced, there was no commonality on
external dimensions e.g. physical size, mounting locations, connector type,
connector location, between vendors.

The first use of these disk drives was in specific applications such as laptop
portable computers and system integrators worked individually with vendors to
develop the packaging. The result was wide diversity, and incompatibility.

The problems faced by integrators, device suppliers, and component suppliers led to
the formation of the SFF Committee as an industry ad hoc group to address the
marketing and engineering considerations of the emerging new technology.

During the development of the form factor definitions, other activities were
suggested because participants in the SFF Committee faced more problems than the
physical form factors of disk drives. In November 1992, the charter was expanded to
address any issues of general interest and concern to the storage industry. The SFF
Committee became a forum for resolving industry issues that are either not
addressed by the standards process or need an immediate solution.

Those companies which have agreed to support a specification are identified in the
first pages of each SFF Specification. Industry consensus is not an essential
requirement to publish an SFF Specification because it is recognized that in an
emerging product area, there is room for more than one approach. By making the
documentation on competing proposals available, an integrator can examine the
alternatives available and select the product that is felt to be most suitable.

SFF Committee meetings are held during T10 weeks (see www.t10.org), and Specific
Subject Working Groups are held at the convenience of the participants. Material
presented at SFF Committee meetings becomes public domain, and there are no
restrictions on the open mailing of material presented at committee meetings.

Most of the specifications developed by the SFF Committee have either been
incorporated into standards or adopted as standards by EIA (Electronic Industries
Association), ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and IEC (International
Electrotechnical Commission).

          SFP+ Power and    Low Speed Interface

1. Scope
This specification defines the low speed electrical and management interface
specifications for SFP+ (enhanced Small Formfactor Pluggable) modules and hosts.
The SFP+ module could be an electrical-to-optical or an electrical-to-electrical
device.

1.1.4     Conventions
The dimensioning conventions are described in ANSI-Y14.5M, Geometric Dimensioning
and Tolerancing. All dimensions are in millimeters, which are the controlling
dimensional units (if inches are supplied, they are for guidance only).

The ISO convention of numbering is used i.e., the thousands and higher multiples
are separated by a space and a period is used as the decimal point. This is
equivalent to the English/American convention of a comma and a period.

2.   Power Requirements
The module host has two 3.3 V power contacts, one supplying the module transmitter
voltage (VccT) and the other supplying the module receiver voltage (VccR). The
maximum current capacity, both continuous and peak, for each connector contact is
500 mA.

SFP+ module maximum power consumption shall meet one of the following power
classes:
      Power Level I modules   - Up to 1.0 W
      Power Level II modules - Up to 1.5 W
      Power Level III modules - Up to 2.0 W

To avoid exceeding system power supply limits and cooling capacity, all modules at
power up by default shall operate with up to 1.0 W. Hosts supporting Power Level II
or III operation may enable a Power Level II or III module through the 2-wire
interface. Power Level II or III modules shall assert the power level declaration
bit of SFF-8472.

The maximum power level is allowed to exceed the classified power level for 500 ms
following hot insertion or power up, or Power Level II or III authorization,
however the current is limited to values given by Table 1 and illustrated in
Figure 1.

At host power up the host shall supply VccT and VccR to the module within 100 ms of
each other.
2.1.1   Module Power Supply Requirements
SFP+ module operates from the host supplied VccT and VccR. To protect the host and
system operation, each SFP+ module during hot plug and normal operation shall
follow the requirements listed in Table 1 and illustrated by Figure 1. The
requirements for current apply to the current through each inductor of Figure 20
while the power supply voltages are defined at the SFP+ connector.
2.1.2   Host Power Supply Noise Output
The host shall generate an effective weighted integrated spectrum RMS noise less
than 25 mV in the frequency range 10 Hz to 10 MHz, according to the methods of
A.1.1.
2.1.3   Module Power Supply Noise Output
The module shall generate less than 15 mV RMS noise at point X of Figure 20 in the
frequency range 10Hz to 10MHz, according to the methods of A.1.2.
2.1.4   Power Supply Noise Tolerance
SFP+ modules shall meet all electrical requirements and remain fully operational in
the presence of a sinusoidal tolerance signal of amplitude given by Table 1 swept
from 10 Hz to 10 MHz according to the methods of A.1.3. This emulates the worst
case noise of the host.

It is also desirable for a module and host to each tolerate a degree of random or
semi-random noise on both VccT and VccR simultaneously, but the characteristics of
this noise are beyond the scope of this document.

Figure 20.
*3 The maximum currents are the allowed currents for each power supply VccT or
VccR, therefore the total module peak currents can be twice this value. The
instantaneous peak current is allowed to exceed the specified maximum current
capacity of the connector contact for a short period, see Figure 1.
*4 Maximum module power consumption shall not exceed 1.0 W from 500ms after power
up until level II operation is enabled.
*5 Not to exceed the sustained peak limit for more than 50 us; may exceed this
limit for shorter durations.

3.    Low Speed Interface

3.1    Introduction
This specification has several enhancements over the classic SFP interface (INF-
8074i), but the SFP+ host can be designed to also support most legacy SFP modules.
SFP+ 2-wire interface electrical and timing specifications are defined in
Section 5, and the SFP+ 2-wire interface management and register map are defined by
SFF-8472.
3.2    Host Connector Definition
The SFP+ host connector is a 0.8 mm pitch 20 position improved connector specified
by SFF-8071, or stacked connector with equivalent electrical performance. Host PCB
contact assignment is shown in Figure 2 and contact definitions are given in
Table 2. SFP+ module contacts mate with the host in the order of ground, power,
followed by signal as illustrated by Figure 3 and the contact sequence order listed
in Table 2.

4.   Low Speed Electrical Control Contacts and 2-Wire Interface
In addition to the 2-wire serial interface, the SFP+ module has the following low
speed contacts for control and status:

        Tx_Fault
        Tx_Disable
        RS0/RS1
        Mod_ABS
        Rx_LOS

4.1.1    Tx_Fault
Tx_Fault is a module output that when high, indicates that the module transmitter
has detected a fault condition related to laser operation or safety. If Tx_Fault is
not implemented, the Tx_Fault contact signal shall be held low by the module and
may be connected to Vee within the module.

The Tx_Fault output is an open drain/collector and shall be pulled up to the
Vcc_Host in the host with a resistor in the range 4.7 kOhms to 10 kOhms, or with an
active termination according to Table 5.
4.1.2    Tx_Disable
When Tx_Disable is asserted high or left open, the SFP+ module transmitter output
shall be turned off unless the module is a passive cable assembly (see Appendix E
in SFF-8418) in which case this signal may be ignored. This contact shall be pulled
up to VccT with a 4.7 kOhms to 10 kOhms resistor in modules and cable assemblies.
Tx_Disable is a module input contact.

When Tx_Disable is asserted low or grounded the module transmitter is operating
normally.
4.1.3    RS0/RS1
RS0 and RS1 are module inputs and are pulled low to VeeT with >30 kOhms resistors
in the module. RS0 optionally selects the optical receive signaling rate coverage.
RS1 optionally selects the optical transmit signaling rate coverage. For logical
definitions of RS0/RS1 see Section 4.2.

These contacts can also be used for AS0 and AS1 if implementing SFF-8079. See SFF-
8079 for details.

RS1 is commonly connected to VeeT or VeeR in the classic SFP modules. The host
needs to ensure that it will not be damaged if this contact is connected to VeeT or
VeeR in the module.
4.1.4    Mod_ABS
Mod_ABS is connected to VeeT or VeeR in the SFP+ module. The host may pull this
contact up to Vcc_Host with a resistor in the range 4.7 kOhms to 10 kOhms. Mod_ABS
is asserted 'High' when the SFP+ module is physically absent from a host slot. In
the SFP MSA (INF-8074i) this contact has the same function but is called MOD_DEF0.
4.1.5    SCL/SDA
SCL is the 2-wire interface clock and SDA is the 2-wire interface data line. SCL
and SDA are pulled up to Vcc_Host_2w by resistors in the host. For full
specifications see Section 5.
4.1.6    Rx_LOS
Rx_LOS when high indicates an optical signal level below that specified in the
relevant standard. Rx_LOS is an open drain/collector output, but may also be used

SFP+ Power and Low Speed Interface                                         Page 14
 Published                                                            SFF-8419 Rev 1.3

as an input by supervisory circuitry in the module. For a nominally 3.3 V Vcc_Host
using a resistive pull up to Vcc_Host the resistor value shall be in the range 4.7
kOhms to 10 kOhms. For a nominally 2.5 V Vcc_Host using a resistive pull up to
Vcc_Host the resistor value shall be in the range 4.7 kOhms to 7.2 kOhms.
Alternatively, an active termination according to Table 5 may be used.

The Rx_LOS signal is intended as a preliminary indication to the host in which the
module is installed that the received signal strength is below the specified range.
Such an indication typically points to non-installed cables, broken cables, or a
disabled, failing or a powered off transmitter at the far end of the cable.
Additional indications are provided by the host in which the module is installed to
verify that the information being transmitted is valid, correctly encoded, and in
the correct format. Such additional indications are outside the scope of the module
specification.

Rx_LOS may be an optional function depending on the supported standard. If the
Rx_LOS function is not implemented, or is reported via the two-wire interface only,
the Rx_LOS contact shall be held low by the module and may be connected to Vee
within the module.

Rx_LOS assert min and de-assert max are defined in the relevant standard. To avoid
spurious transition of Rx_LOS a minimum hysteresis of 0.5 dBo is recommended.

4.2     Rate Select Hardware Control
The SFP+ module provides two inputs RS0 and RS1 that can optionally be used for
rate selection. RS0 controls the receive path signalling rate capability, and RS1
controls the transmit path signalling rate capability, as defined in Table 3. The
host and module may choose to use either, both, or none of these functions. Because
contact 9 in the classic SFP INF-8074i is connected to VeeR, an SFP+ host utilizing
RS1 must provide short circuit protection.

This rate select functionality can also be controlled by software as defined by
SFF-8472.

Optionally the rate select methods of Part 2 of SFF-8079 may be used instead of the
method described here by setting the management declaration bit (A0h byte 93 bit 2)
to 1, see SFF-8472.

            RS1
                     High    TX signalling rate greater than 4.25 GBd

4.3     Low Speed Electrical Specifications
SFP+ low speed signalling is based on Low Voltage TTL (LVTTL) operating with a
module supply of 3.3 V +/-5% and with a host supply range of 2.38 to 3.46 V.

The 2-wire interface protocol and electrical specifications are defined in
Section 5.
4.3.1    Module Low Speed Electrical Specifications

4.4.1   Module Power On Initialization Procedure, Tx_Disable Negated
During power on of the module, Tx_Fault, if implemented, may be asserted (high) as
soon as power supply voltages are within specification. For module initialization
with Tx_Disable negated, Tx_Fault shall be negated when the transmitter safety
circuitry, if implemented, has detected that the transmitter is operating in its
normal state. If a transmitter fault has not occurred, Tx_Fault shall be negated
within a period t_start_up from the time that VccT exceeds the specified minimum
operating voltage (see SFF-8418 SFP+ Module Power Supply Requirements). If the

Tx_Fault remains asserted after t_start_up, the host shall determine whether the
module is cooled by reading the status bit over 2-wire interface. If the module is
not cooled, the host may assume that a transmission fault has occurred. If the
module is cooled, the host may assume that a transmission fault has occurred if
Tx_Fault remains asserted beyond t_start_up_cooled.

The power on initialization timing for a module with Tx_Disable negated is shown in
Figure 4.

4.4.2    Module Power On Initialization Procedure, Tx_Disable Asserted.
For module power on initialization with Tx_Disable asserted, the state of Tx_Fault
is not defined while Tx_Disable is asserted. After Tx_Disable is negated, Tx_Fault
may be asserted while safety circuit initialization is performed. Tx_Fault shall be
negated when the transmitter safety circuitry, if implemented, has detected that
the transmitter is operating in its normal state. If a transmitter fault has not
occurred, Tx_Fault shall be negated within a period t_start_up from the time that
Tx_Disable is negated. If Tx_Fault remains asserted beyond the period t_start_up,
the host may assume that a transmission fault has been detected by the module.

If no transmitter safety circuitry is implemented, the Tx_Fault signal may be tied
to its negated state.

The power on initialization timing for a module with Tx_Disable asserted is shown
in Figure 5.

4.4.3     Initialization During Hot Plugging
When a module is not installed, Tx_Fault is held to the asserted state by the pull
up circuits on the host. As the module is installed, contact is made with the
ground, voltage, and signal contacts in the specified order. After the module has
determined that VccT has reached the specified value, the power on initialization
takes place as described in the previous section. An example of initialization
during hot plugging is provided in Figure 6.

The timing requirements for the management of optical outputs from the module using
the Tx_Disable signal are shown in Figure 7. Note that t_on time refers to the
maximum delay until the modulated optical signal reaches 90% of the final value,
not just the average optical power.

4.4.6    Module Fault Recovery
The detection of a safety-related transmitter fault condition presented by Tx_Fault
shall be latched. The following protocol may be used to reset the latch in case the
transmitter fault condition is transient.

To reset the fault condition and associated detection circuitry, Tx_Disable shall
be asserted for a minimum of t_reset. Tx_Disable shall then be negated.
Alternatively the Software Tx disable is asserted and negated. In less than the
maximum value of t_start_up the optical transmitter will correctly reinitialize the
laser circuits, negate Tx_Fault, and begin normal operation if the fault condition
is no longer present.

If a fault condition is detected during the reinitialization, Tx_Fault shall again
be asserted, the fault condition again latched, and the optical transmitter
circuitry will again be disabled until the next time a reset protocol is attempted.
The manufacturer of the module shall ensure that the optical power emitted from an
open connector or fiber is compliant with applicable eye safety requirements during
all reset attempts, during normal operation or upon the occurrence of reasonable
single fault conditions.

The module may require internal protective circuitry to prevent the frequent
assertion of the Tx_Disable signal from generating frequent pulses of energy that
violate the safety requirements. Timing for successful recovery from a transient
safety fault condition is shown in Figure 9.

5.    SFP+ 2-Wire Interface

5.1    Introduction
The SFP+ management interface is a two-wire interface, similar to I2C. SFP+
management memory map is specified by SFF-8472. Nomenclature for all registers more
than 1 bit long are MSB...LSB (MSB transmitted first).
5.2    2-Wire Interface Electrical Specifications
The SFP+ 2-wire interface specifications are given in Table 7. These specifications
ensure compatibility between host masters and SFP+ SCL/SDA lines and compatibility
with I2C. All voltages are referenced to VeeT.

5.5   Device Addressing and Operation
Serial Clock        The host supplied SCL input to SFP+ transceivers is used to
(SCL)               positively edge clock data into each SFP+ device and negative
                    edge clock data out of each device. The SCL line may be pulled
                    low by an SFP+ module during clock stretching.
Serial Data (SDA)   The SDA contact is bi-directional for serial data transfer.
                    This contact is open-drain or open-collector driven and may be
                    wire-ORed with other open-drain or open collector devices with
                    different device addresses, provided the total bus capacitance

SFP+ Power and Low Speed Interface                                              Page 25
Published                                                         SFF-8419 Rev 1.3

                    meets the requirement of Table 7 and the Serial Clock (SCL) is
                    also wire-ORed.
Master/Slave        SFP+ transceivers operate only as slave devices. The host must
                    provide a bus master for SCL and initiate all read/write
                    communication.
Device Address      Each SFP+ is hard wired at the device addresses A0h and A2h.
                    See SFF-8472 for memory structure within each transceiver.
Clock and Data      The SDA contact is normally pulled high with an external
Transitions         device. Data on the SDA contact may change only during SCL low
                    time periods. Data changes during SCL high periods indicate a
                    START or STOP condition. All addresses and data words are
                    serially transmitted to and from the SFP+ in 8-bit words. Every
                    byte on the SDA line must be 8-bits long. Data is transferred
                    with the most significant bit (MSB) first.
START Condition     A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high is a START
                    condition, which must precede any other command.
STOP Condition      A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a STOP
                    condition.
Acknowledge         After sending each 8-bit word, the transmitter releases the SDA
                    line for one bit time, during which the receiver is allowed to
                    pull SDA low (zero) to acknowledge (ACK) that it has received
                    each word. Device address bytes and write data bytes initiated
                    by the host shall be acknowledged by SFP+ transceivers. Read
                    data bytes transmitted by SFP+ transceivers shall be
                    acknowledged by the host for all but the final byte read, for
                    which the host shall respond with a STOP instead of an ACK.
Non-acknowledge     When a slave is unable to receive or transmit, because, e.g.,
(NACK)              it is performing a higher priority function, the data line
                    shall be left high by the slave. A NACK is generated when the
                    slave leaves the data line high during the ACK clock pulse. The
                    master can then generate either a STOP condition to abort the
                    transfer or a repeated START condition to start a new transfer.

                    When in a transfer, a master-receiver must signal the end of
                    data to the slave-transmitter by not generating an acknowledge
                    on the last byte clocked out of the slave. A NACK is generated
                    when the master leaves the data line High during the ACK clock
                    pulse. The slave-transmitter must release the data line to
                    permit the master to generate a STOP or repeated START
                    condition.

Device Addressing   SFP+ devices require an 8 bit device address word following a
                    start condition to enable a read or write operation. The device
                    addresses to select A0h or A2h are shown in Table 10. This is
                    common to all SFP+ devices.

           The LSB of the device address word is the read/write operating
           select bit. A read operation is initiated if this bit is set high
           and a write operation is initiated if this bit is set low.

5.6     Read/Write Functionality
The methods for reading from and writing to the two different SFP+ addresses A0h
and A2h are described in this section. They are identical for the two different
addresses except that the appropriate address is used for each read and write. For
simplicity in the figures the address is labelled 101000x where the x is 0 for the
A0h address and 1 for the A2h address. Note that the address here is only seven
bits. In order to complete the full 8 bit byte a one or zero is added to the end of
the address depending on whether a read or a write operation is taking place.
5.6.1    Memory Address Counter (Read and Write Operations)
SFP+ devices maintain two internal data word address counters one for each address.
These counters contain the last address accessed during the latest read or write
operation, incremented by one. The address counter is incremented whenever a data
word is received or sent by the transceiver. This address stays valid between
operations as long as SFP+ power is maintained. The address 'roll over' during read
and write operations is from the last byte of the 256 byte memory page to the first
byte of the same page.
5.6.2    Read Operations (Current Address Read)
A current address read operation requires only that the device address read word
(10100001 or 10100011) be sent, Figure 14. Once acknowledged by the SFP+, the
current address data word is serially clocked out. The host does not respond with
an acknowledge, but does generate a STOP condition once the data word is read.




                        FIGURE 14 CURRENT ADDRESS READ OPERATION


5.6.3    Read Operations (Random Read)
A random read operation requires a 'dummy' write operation to load in the target
byte address Figure 15. This is accomplished by the following sequence: The target
8-bit data word address is sent following the device address write word (10100000
or 10100010) and acknowledged by the SFP+. The host then generates another START
condition (aborting the dummy write without incrementing the counter) and a current
address read by sending a device read address (10100001 or 10100011). The SFP+
acknowledges the device address and serially clocks out the requested data word.

The host does not respond with an acknowledge, but does generate a STOP condition
once the data word is read.




                               FIGURE 15 RANDOM READ


5.6.4   Read Operations (Sequential Read)
Sequential reads are initiated by either a current word address read Figure 16 or a
random address read Figure 17. To specify a sequential read, the host responds with
an acknowledge (instead of a STOP) after each data word. As long as the SFP+
receives an acknowledge, it shall serially clock out sequential data words. The
sequence is terminated when the host responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an
acknowledge.

            FIGURE 17 SEQUENTIAL ADDRESS READ STARTING WITH RANDOM READ


5.6.5   Write Operations (Byte Write)
A write operation requires an 8-bit data word address following the device address

write word (10100000 or 10100010) and acknowledgement Figure 18. Upon receipt of
this address, the SFP+ shall again respond with a zero (ACK) to acknowledge and
then clock in the first 8 bit data word. Following the receipt of the 8 bit data
word, the SFP+ shall output a zero (ACK) and the host master must terminate the
write sequence with a STOP condition for the write cycle to begin. If a START
condition is sent in place of a STOP condition (i.e. a repeated START per the I2C
specification) the write is aborted and the data received during that operation is
discarded. Upon receipt of the proper STOP condition, the SFP+ enters an internally
timed write cycle, tWR, to internal memory. The SFP+ disables its management
interface input during this write cycle and shall not respond or acknowledge
subsequent commands until the write is complete. Note that I2C 'Combined Format'
using repeated START conditions is not supported on SFP+ write commands.




                        FIGURE 18 SFP+ WRITE BYTE OPERATION


5.6.6   Write Operations (Sequential Write)
SFP+ shall support up to an 8 sequential byte write without repeatedly sending SFP+
address and memory address information. A 'sequential' write is initiated the same
way as a single byte write, but the host master does not send a stop condition
after the first word is clocked in. Instead, after the SFP+ acknowledges receipt of
the first data word, the host can transmit up to seven more data words. The SFP+
shall send an acknowledge after each data word received. The host must terminate
the sequential write sequence with a STOP condition or the write operation shall be
aborted and data discarded. Note that I2C 'combined format' using repeated START
conditions is not supported on SFP+ write commands.




                        FIGURE 19 SEQUENTIAL WRITE OPERATION


5.6.7   Write Operations (Acknowledge Polling)
Once the SFP+ internally timed write cycle has begun (and inputs are being ignored
on the bus) acknowledge polling can be used to determine when the write operation
is complete. This involves sending a START condition followed by the device address

word. Only if the internal write cycle is complete shall the SFP+ respond with an
acknowledge to subsequent commands, indicating read or write operations can
continue.

A.   Test Methodology And Measurement (Normative)

A.1 Power Supply Testing Methodology
This section defines power supply noise output as given in 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, and
power supply noise tolerance as in 2.1.4.

The reference power supply filter shown in Figure 20 is provided for module
testing, including power supply tolerance testing. This filter will meet the noise
filtering requirements in most host systems. Other filtering implementations or
local regulation may be used to meet the power noise output requirements described
in 2.1.2 and 2.1.3.

For each Vcc, the sum of the equivalent series resistances of the 4.7uH inductor,
the 22uF capacitor and the damping resistor is 0.5 Ohms. This resistance is
desirable in actual host filters as well as in the reference filter; however, any
voltage drop across a filter network on the host is counted against the host VccT
and VccR accuracy specification in Table 1.




                FIGURE 20 MODULE COMPLIANCE BOARD POWER SUPPLY FILTERS


A.1.1 Host Power Supply Noise Output
The noise output of a Vcc supply of a host is defined with a resistive load that
draws the maximum rated power (1 W or 1.5 W) connected between one Vcc contact and
Vee, in place of the SFP+ module. When the noise on VccT is being measured, VccR is
left open circuit, and vice versa. 8 Ohms is used for a host capable of supporting
Power Level II, and 12 Ohms otherwise. The AC voltage spectrum is measured at the
module side of the SFP+ connector. The noise power spectrum is divided by the
truncated response of the reference filter and then integrated from 10 Hz to 10 MHz
and converted to a voltage. This function is illustrated in the equation below and
Figure 21. The specification limit is given in 2.1.2. The test is performed with
all other portions of the host board/system active. Hosts with multiple SFP+
modules shall test ports one at a time, with active SFP+ in all the remaining
ports.

The reference filter response H(f) shown in Figure 21 and the coefficients a, b, c,
d, and e for the 5 frequency bands are defined in Table 11.

NOTES: As a lightly loaded power supply might generate more noise than a fully
loaded supply, the host implementer may wish to assess the host power supply noise
output at less than maximum current draw also. Because a small measured noise
signal at high frequencies is multiplied up to give the inferred noise at virtual
point X, care should be taken over the noise floor of the spectrum analyzer. Other
measurement methods could be used, e.g. a measurement at a point inside the host,
with appropriate consideration to any difference between the reference filter and a
host's actual filter.
A.1.2 SFP+ Module Power Supply Noise Output
The module noise voltage output is defined in the frequency band 10 Hz to 10 MHz at
point X in Figure 20.

The module must pass module power supply noise output test in all operating modes.
This test ensures the module will not couple excessive noise from inside the module
back onto the host board. A power meter technique, or a spectrum analyzer technique
with integration of the spectrum, may be used. The maximum allowed noise amplitude

is given in 2.1.3.
A.1.3 Module Power Supply Tolerance Testing
In this test, a swept sinusoidal tone is applied at point X of Figure 22 with the
tolerance signal amplitude and frequency range given in 2.1.4. The AC tolerance
signal is created by a circuit such as a low impedance buffer amplifier between the
power supply and point X. The impedance of the PSU and sine wave generator is less
than 0.5 Ohms. The amplitude of the sine wave is calibrated at each frequency at
point X with the module replaced with a 12 Ohms load between Vcc and Vee.

NOTES -- It may be desirable to remove the 0.1 uF capacitors on the host side of
the reference filters for this test, to reduce the power needed by the sine wave
generator. The calibration of the sine wave is not expected to be significantly
different if the module were in place rather than the test resistor.

Alternatively, the test may be performed separately for VccT and VccR with the
other supply filter connected directly to the power supply. It is not necessary to
show compliance with both separate and common Vcc modulation.

This test applies at minimum and maximum DC setpoint levels. Note that the DC level
is inset to the limits in SFF-8419 Low Speed Module Electrical Specifications by
the peak of the sinusoidal voltage at the input to the module (which is frequency
dependent).

The source frequency is varied over the range specified by 2.1.4 to determine if
any frequency causes a parameter to fall out of the specification limit. In all
cases, the parameters measured shall pass the optical standards with the tone
present over all frequencies specified. Parameters of interest for the transmit may
include UJ, Qsq and TDP see [IEEE 802.3]. For the receive side, they include
stressed sensitivity, overload, RN and Rx_LOS function.




                 FIGURE 22 POWER SUPPLY NOISE TOLERANCE TEST SETUP

The AC voltage at node X is defined with reference to Vee. The DC voltage
specification including ripple, droop and noise below 100 kHz is met at both VccT
and VccR (at the SFP+ connector).
