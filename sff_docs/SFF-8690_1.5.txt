1 Scope

This specification supplements SFF-8472 management interface to include management of tunable pluggable
transceiver modules. Pluggable modules such as the SFP+, SFP28 and future SFP form factor that are compliant
to SFF-8431, SFF-8419 and SFF-8472 may use this management interface; hereafter referred to as SFP+.
Electrical, mechanical, and thermal interface details remain without change as specified in SFF-8431 and SFF-
8419.

The scope of this SFF-8690 defines management interfaces for managing:
 - Tunable transmitter
 - Increased frequency resolution for wavelength reporting.
 - Smart Tunable MSA defining optional Self Tuning between Transceivers.

This specification is applicable when A0h byte 65 bit 6 is set to 1 (as defined in SFF-8472) to indicate the
availability of tunability in the pluggable module. A non-tunable module does not need to support registers
defined in this specification.

this SFF specification makes a reference, where the use of said feature, function, or coded value is not allowed
for implementations of this specification.

Reserved: Defines the signal on a connector contact. Its actual function is set aside for future standardization. It
is not available for vendor specific use. Where this term is used for bits, bytes, fields, and code values; the bits,
bytes, fields, and code values are set aside for future standardization. The default value shall be zero. The
originator is required to define a Reserved field or bit as zero, but the receiver should not check Reserved fields
or bits for zero.

Restricted: Refers to features, bits, bytes, words, and fields that are set aside for other standardization
purposes. If the context of the specification applies the restricted designation, then the restricted bit, byte, word,
or field shall be treated as a value whose definition is not in scope of this document, and is not interpreted by this
specification.

Shall: Indicates a mandatory requirement. Designers are required to implement all such mandatory requirements

4 General Description
SFF-8431 defines the 10 Gigabit Small Formfactor Pluggable SFP+ Module including electrical, mechanical, and
thermal requirements. 2-wire management interface details are defined in SFF-8472. (The range of pluggable
modules types applicable to this SFF standards are discussed Scope Section 1)

In the SFF-8472 specification, an Optical Variant Transceiver (A0h Byte 8 bits 3-2 are 0s) advertises the
transmitter wavelength in 1 nanometer resolution at A0h bytes 60 and 61. In addition byte 62 may be used to
report wavelength in 0.01 nm (value 0 to 99). Since A0h low memory bytes are intended to be read-only
EEPROM, the recommended behavior is that A0h bytes 60-62 all reporting 0’s for tunable transceivers, as A0h
byte 63 is the EEPROM checksum. However, historically after the initial release of SFF-8690, custom specification
had arisen to define A0h bytes 60-62 report the current wavelength, after a channel switch. This behavior will
remain undefined by SFF-8690.

Many applications for a tunable SFP+ must conform to an ITU frequency grid of 50 GHz (approximately 400
picometers). DWDM specifications also demand spectral excursion limits that can be as tight as ±2.5 GHz under
normal operating conditions. Thus 1 nanometer wavelength step size defined in SFF-8472 does not adequately
define the wavelength of a tunable SFP+.

To avoid possible conflict with legacy tuning systems designed to SFF-8472, the frequency grid tuning commands
of SFF-8690 supplement rather than supplant the wavelength definitions of SFF-8472. These frequency grid
tuning commands are detailed in Section 5.

5 Tuning Management Interface for DWDM Applications

5.1 Memory Map Changes to A0h and A2h
Tunable SFP+ implements A0h and A2h as in SFF-8472 with the modification herein.

A0h byte 65 bit 6, shall indicate transmitter technology. If the value of bit 6 is 0 the transmitter is not tunable. If
the value of bit 6 is 1 the transmitter technology is tunable.

Tunable SFP+ Control/Status, consisting of addressable locations A2h at bytes 128 and 132 to 173 are accessible
when the Page Select Byte is set to page 02h. Register definitions in the bytes described in the remainder of this
section is based on the Page Select Byte set to 02h. All undefined registers in the byte ranged described are
reserved and are set to 00h.

5.2 Byte Definitions
The Tunable SFP+ module may be tuned by several methods which shall be advertised in A2h Byte 128. Table
5-3 bits 0,1,3 and 4 defines 4 methods.

The Tunable SFP+ module may support “Tx Dither” for the suppression of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS).
Support for Tx dithering is indicated by A2h byte 128 bit 2.

                                                            NOTE: LGrid can be a positive or negative number.

A desired frequency channel can be commanded by the user by writing into A2h bytes 144 (MSB) and 145 (LSB).

The channel number is derived from the following equation using parameters found in Module capabilities as
listed in A2h bytes 132-141:

Channel number = 1 + (Desired Frequency - First Frequency) / Grid Spacing

Alternatively, a desired wavelength on the ITU grid can be commanded by the user by writing into A2h bytes 146
(MSB) and 147 (LSB). Thus for instance a target wavelength of 1556.55 nm would correspond to 79h (MSB)
written to A2h byte 146 and 9Bh (LSB) written to A2h byte 147.

The behavior of writing bytes 144-145 and 146-147, and the precedence in how and which frequency the module
tunes is not defined in the specification especially if there is a mismatch in frequencies commanded by the host in
a TWI write to 144-145 and 146-147. It is assumed that the host should use a 2 byte TWI transaction.

If Self-Tuning is enabled and cycling through the channels, the module shall update the channel number bytes
144-145 and the wavelength bytes 146-147 with the current active channel under test as the module is cycling
through the channels. A host reading through the register will know that the module is self tuning. A write to
these registers during self tuning should be ignored.

A2h byte 151 bit 0 can be used to enable and disable TX Dithering, if Byte 128 bit 2 indicates that Tx Dither is
supported.

Frequency and wavelength control commands are detailed in Table 5-5.

                                                    in indeterminate behavior. The host is expected to
                                                    manage the channel once the bit is set to 0.

                                                    no impact in behavior. Writing this bit to 1 if this bit
                                                    was previously 0 will restart self tuning.

Digital Diagnostics and Alarms

A2 bytes 152-155, 168, and 172 contain digital diagnostic monitoring and alarms.

The frequency error in bytes 152-153 and wavelength error in bytes 154-155 are 16 bit signed 2's complement
value in units of 0.1 GHz and 0.005 nm respectively. Both these error reporting registers should be implemented
by the module. NOTE: Frequency and wavelength error is expected to be “actual measured value” – “target
value”. This error was not defined in prior releases. If frequency error is positive, then the corresponding
wavelength error should be negative.

A2h byte 172 is the latched status register. The latched indicators for TEC Fault and Wavelength Unlock are
located here. Bit 4, Bad Channel, indicates a bad channel number request (i.e., a channel number outside of the
supported range). Bit 3, New Channel, indicates that a channel change operation has completed. Bit 2 indicates
that Tx Dither has been requested in a module that does not support dithering.

6 Color Coding and Labeling of Tunable SFP+ Transceiver
The bail latch, which is an exposed feature of the tunable SFP+ transceiver (a feature or surface extending
outside of the bezel) has been traditionally color coded. Historically, the current color coding of the bail latch,
shall be color coded as follows:

- Green for negative chirp tunable SFP+.
- Yellow or green for zero chirp tunable SFP+.

In future, this SFF-8690 specification will not specify mechanical nor color coding scheme beyond what is
previously specified. Hence the above text is left as it is in this revision of the specification, and new color codes
will not be specified in this document.

The SFF committee decided to leave these figures un-annotated in this 1.4.2 release.
