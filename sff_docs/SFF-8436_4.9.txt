Foreword

The development work on this specification was done by the SFF Committee, an industry
group. The membership of the committee since its formation in August 1990 has included a
mix of companies which are leaders across the industry.

When 2 1/2" diameter disk drives were introduced, there was no commonality on external
dimensions e.g. physical size, mounting locations, connector type, and connector
location, between vendors.

The first use of these disk drives was in specific applications such as laptop portable
computers and system integrators worked individually with vendors to develop the
packaging. The result was wide diversity, and incompatibility.

The problems faced by integrators, device suppliers, and component suppliers led to the
formation of the SFF Committee as an industry ad hoc group to address the marketing and
engineering considerations of the emerging new technology.

During the development of the form factor definitions, other activities were suggested
because participants in the SFF Committee faced more problems than the physical form
factors of disk drives. In November 1992, the charter was expanded to address any issues
of general interest and concern to the storage industry. The SFF Committee became a forum
for resolving industry issues that are either not addressed by the standards process or
need an immediate solution.

Those companies which have agreed to support a specification are identified in the first
pages of each SFF Specification. Industry consensus is not an essential requirement to
publish an SFF Specification because it is recognized that in an emerging product area,
there is room for more than one approach. By making the documentation on competing
proposals available, an integrator can examine the alternatives available and select the
product that is felt to be most suitable.

SFF Committee meetings are held during T10 weeks (see www.t10.org), and Specific Subject
Working Groups are held at the convenience of the participants. Material presented at SFF
Committee meetings becomes public domain, and there are no restrictions on the open
mailing of material presented at committee meetings.

Most of the specifications developed by the SFF Committee have either been incorporated
into standards or adopted as standards by EIA (Electronic Industries Association), ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) and IEC (International Electrotechnical
Commission).

An application reference Model, See Figure 1, shows the high-speed data interface between
an ASIC (SerDes) and the QSFP+ module. Only one data channel of the interface is shown
for simplicity. Either parallel MPO or duplex LC fiber connectors can be used for the
optical interface.

QSFP+ reference points for 6Gb/s and lower speeds are as follows:

A: Host ASIC transmitter output at ASIC package pin on a DUT board

B: Host ASIC transmitter output across the Host Board and Host Edge Card connector at the
Module Card Edge interface

B’: Host ASIC transmitter output across the Host Board at Host Edge Card Connector

C: QSFP+ receiver output at the Module Card Edge interface

C’: QSFP+ receiver output at Host Edge Card Connector

D: QSFP+ receiver output at Host ASIC package receiver input pin on a DUT board

Note: For speeds above 6Gb/s the compliance board methodology of IEEE802.3ba, FC-PI4 and
SFF8431 should be used.   Measurements taken with QSFP+ compliance boards should be
corrected for any difference between the loss of these compliance boards and the loss of
the compliance boards specified in the standard.


4 Electrical Specification
This clause contains pin definition data for the QSFP+ Module. The pin definition data is
generic for gigabit -per-second datacom applications such as Fibre Channel and Gigabit
Ethernet and SONET/ATM applications. Compliance Points for high-speed signal electrical
measurements are defined in Figure 1. Compliance Points for all other electrical signals
are at comparable points at the host edge card connector.

4.1 Electrical Connector
Figure 2 shows the signal symbols and contact numbering for the QSFP+ Module edge
connector. The diagram shows the module PCB edge as a top and bottom view. There are 38
contacts intended for high speed, low speed signals, power and ground connections. Table
3 provides more information about each of the 38 contacts.

For EMI protection the signals to the connector should be shut off when the QSFP+ Module
is removed. Standard board layout practices such as connections to Vcc and GND with Vias,
use of short and equal-length differential signal lines, use of microstrip-lines and 50
Ohm terminations are recommended. The chassis ground (case common) of the QSFP+ module

should be isolated from the module’s circuit ground, GND, to provide the equipment
designer flexibility regarding connections between external electromagnetic interference
shields and circuit ground, GND, of the module.

4.1.1 Low Speed Electrical Hardware Pins
In addition to the 2-wire serial interface the module has the following low speed pins
for control and status:

      ModSelL
      ResetL
      LPMode

      ModPrsL
      IntL

4.1.1.1 ModSelL
The ModSelL is an input pin. When held low by the host, the module responds to 2-wire
serial communication commands. The ModSelL allows the use of multiple QSFP+ modules on a
single 2-wire interface bus. When the ModSelL is “High”, the module shall not respond to
or acknowledge any 2-wire interface communication from the host. ModSelL signal input
node must be biased to the “High” state in the module.

In order to avoid conflicts, the host system shall not attempt 2-wire interface
communications within the ModSelL de-assert time after any QSFP+ modules are deselected.
Similarly, the host must wait at least for the period of the ModSelL assert time before
communicating with the newly selected module. The assertion and de-asserting periods of
different modules may overlap as long as the above timing requirements are met.

4.1.1.2 ResetL
The ResetL pin must be pulled to Vcc in the QSFP+ module. A low level on the ResetL pin
for longer than the minimum pulse length (t_Reset_init) initiates a complete module
reset, returning all user module settings to their default state. Module Reset Assert
Time (t_init) starts on the rising edge after the low level on the ResetL pin is
released. During the execution of a reset (t_init) the host shall disregard all status
bits until the module indicates a completion of the reset interrupt. The module indicates
this by asserting “low” an IntL signal with the Data_Not_Ready bit negated. Note that on
power up (including hot insertion) the module should post this completion of reset
interrupt without requiring a reset.

4.1.1.3 LPMode
The LPMode pin shall be pulled up to Vcc in the QSFP+ module. This function is affected
by the LPMode pin and the combination of the Power_over-ride and Power_set software
control bits (Address A0h, byte 93 bits 0,1).

The module has two modes a low power mode and a high power mode. The high power mode
operates in one of the four power classes.

When the module is in a low power mode it has a maximum power consumption of 1.5W.   This
protects hosts that are not capable of cooling higher power modules, should such modules
be accidentally inserted.

The modules 2-wire serial interface and all laser safety functions must be fully
operational in this low power mode.   The module shall still support the completion of
reset interrupt in this low power mode.

If the Extended Identifier bits (Page 00h, byte 129 bits 6-7) indicate a power
consumption greater than 1.5W and the module is in low power mode it must reduce its
power consumption to less than 1.5W while still maintaining the functionality above. The
exact method of accomplishing low power is not specified, however it is likely that
either the Tx or Rx or both will not be operational in this state.

If the Extended Identifier bits (Page 00h, byte 129 bits 6-7) indicate that its power
consumption is less than 1.5W then the module shall be fully functional independent of
whether it is in low power or high power mode.

The Module should be in low power mode if the LPMode pin is in the high state, or if the
Power_ override bit is in the high state and the Power_set bit is also high.    The
module should be in high power mode if the LPMode pin is in the low state, or the
Power_override bit is high and the Power_set bit is low.   Note that the default state
for the Power_override bit is low.

A truth table for the relevant configurations of the LPMode and the Power_over-ride and
Power_set are shown in Table 4.

At Power up, the Power_override and Power_set bits shall be set to 0.

4.1.1.4 ModPrsL
ModPrsL is pulled up to Vcc_Host on the host board and grounded in the module. The
ModPrsL is asserted “Low” when inserted and deasserted “High” when the module is
physically absent from the host connector.

4.1.1.5 IntL
IntL is an output pin. When “Low”, it indicates a possible module operational fault or a
status critical to the host system. The host identifies the source of the interrupt using
the 2-wire serial interface. The IntL pin is an open collector output and must be pulled
to host supply voltage on the host board. The INTL pin is deasserted “High” after
completion of reset, when byte 2 bit 0 (Data Not Ready)is read with a value of ‘0’ and
the flag field is read (see 7.6.1.2).

4.1.2 Low Speed Electrical Specification
Low speed signaling other than SCL and SDA is based on Low Voltage TTL (LVTTL) operating
at Vcc. Vcc refers to the generic supply voltages of VccTx, VccRx, Vcc_host or Vcc1.
Hosts shall use a pull-up resistor connected to Vcc_host on each of the 2-wire interface
SCL (clock), SDA (data), and all low speed status outputs. The SCL and SDA is a hot plug
interface that may support a bus topology. During module insertion or removal, the module
may implement a pre-charge circuit which prevents corrupting data transfers from other
modules that are already using the bus.

Note 1-Timing diagrams for SCL and SDA are included in Subclause 6.2.2.

The QSFP+ low speed electrical specifications are given in Table 5. This specification
ensures compatibility between host bus masters and the 2-wire interface.

4.1.3 High Speed Electrical Specification

4.1.3.1 Rx(n)(p/n)
Rx(n)(p/n) are QSFP+ module receiver data outputs. Rx(n)(p/n) are AC-coupled 100 Ohm
differential lines that should be terminated with 100 Ohm differentially at the Host
ASIC(SerDes). The AC coupling is inside the QSFP+ module and not required on the Host
board. When properly terminated, the differential voltage swing shall be less than or
equal to 1600 mVpp or the relevant standard, whichever is less.

Note: Due to the possibility of insertion of QSFP modules into a host designed for QSFP+,
it is recommended that the damage threshold of the host input be at least 1600 mV peak to
peak differential.

Output squelch for loss of optical input signal, hereafter Rx Squelch, is required and
shall function as follows. In the event of the optical signal on any channel becoming
equal to or less than the level required to assert LOS, then the receiver data output for
that channel shall be squelched or disabled. In the squelched or disabled state output
impedance levels are maintained while the differential voltage swing shall be less than
50 mVpp.

In normal operation the default case has Rx Squelch active. Rx Squelch can be
deactivated using Rx Squelch Disable through the 2-wire serial interface. Rx Squelch
Disable is an optional function. For specific details refer to Subclause 7.6.5.2.

4.1.3.2 Tx(n)(p/n)
Tx(n)(p/n) are QSFP+ module transmitter data inputs. They are AC-coupled 100 Ohm
differential lines with 100 Ohm differential terminations inside the QSFP+ module. The
AC coupling is inside the QSFP+ module and not required on the Host board. For operation
at 6 Gb/s and below the inputs will accept single-ended voltage swings between 250 mV to
800 mV and differential voltage swings between 500 mVpp to 1600 mVpp. For best EMI
results, single-ended swings between 250 mV and 600 mV and differential voltage swings
between 500 mVpp to 1200 mVpp are recommended. For operation above 6 Gb/s see the
appropriate specification, e.g. 802.3ba Annex 86A, FC-PI-4, FC-PI-5 or the InfiniBand
specification. For 10G Ethernet reference SFF-8431.

Due to the possibility of insertion of QSFP+ modules into a host designed for QSFP
interface per INF-8438i the damage threshold of the module input shall be at least 1600
mV peak to peak differential.



QSFP+ 4X 10 GB/S Pluggable Transceiver                                            Page 20

Output squelch, hereafter Tx Squelch, for loss of input signal, hereafter Tx LOS, is an
optional function. Where implemented it shall function as follows. In the event of the
differential, peak-to-peak electrical signal on any channel becomes less than 50 mVpp,
then the transmitter optical output for that channel shall be squelched or disabled and
the associated TxLOS flag set.

Where squelched, the transmitter OMA shall be less than or equal to -26 dBm and when
disabled the transmitter power shall be less than or equal to -30 dBm. For applications,
e.g. Ethernet, where the transmitter off condition is defined in terms of average power,
disabling the transmitter is recommended and for applications, e.g. InfiniBand, where the
transmitter off condition is defined in terms of OMA, squelching the transmitter is
recommended.

In module operation, where Tx Squelch is implemented, the default case has Tx Squelch
active. Tx Squelch can be deactivated using Tx Squelch Disable through the 2-wire serial
interface. Tx Squelch Disable is an optional function. For specific details refer to
Clause 7.6.5.2.

4.2 Power Requirements
The power supply has three designated pins, Vcc Tx, Vcc1, and Vcc Rx, in the connector.
Vcc1 is used to supplement Vcc Tx or Vcc Rx at the discretion of the module vendor. Power
is applied concurrently to these pins.

Since different classes of modules exist with pre-defined maximum power consumption
limits, it is necessary to avoid exceeding the system power supply limits and cooling
capacity when a module is inserted into a system designed to only accommodate lower power
modules. It is recommended that the host, through the management interface, identify the
power consumption class of the module before allowing the module to go into high power
mode.

A host board together with the QSFP+ module(s) forms an integrated power system. The host
supplies stable power to the module. The module limits electrical noise coupled back into
the host system and limits inrush charge/current during hot plug insertion.

All specifications shall be met at the maximum power supply current. No power sequencing
of the power supply is required of the host system since the module sequences the
contacts in the order of ground, supply and signals during insertion.

4.2.1 Host Board Power Supply Filtering
The host board should use the power supply filtering equivalent to that shown in Figure
4.

                  Figure 4 Recommended Host Board Power Supply Filtering

Any voltage drop across a filter network on the host is counted against the host DC set
point accuracy specification. Inductors with DC Resistance of less than 0.1 Ohm should be
used in order to maintain the required voltage at the Host Edge Card Connector. It is
recommended that the 22 uF capacitors each have an equivalent series resistance of 0.22
ohm.

The specification for the power supply is shown in Table 6.

In general, the higher power classification level is associated with higher data rates
and longer reach. The system designer is responsible for ensuring that the maximum
temperature does not exceed the case temperature requirements.


4.3 ESD
Where ESD performance is not otherwise specified, e.g. in the InfiniBand specification,
the QSFP+ module shall meet ESD requirements given in EN61000-4-2, criterion B test
specification when installed in a properly grounded cage and chassis. The units are
subjected to 15kV air discharges during operation and 8kV direct contact discharges to
the case. The QSFP+ module and host high speed signal contacts shall withstand 1000 V
electrostatic discharge based on Human Body Model per JEDEC JESD22-A114-B.

The QSFP+ module and all host contacts with exception of the module and host high speed
signal contacts shall withstand 2 kV electrostatic discharge based on Human Body Model
per JEDEC JESD22-A114-B.

5 Mechanical and Board Definition

5.1 Introduction
The overall module defined in this clause is illustrated in Figure 6. All Pluggable
modules and direct attach cable plugs must mate to the connector and cage design defined
in this specification. The QSFP+ optical interface shall meet the dimensional
specifications of IEC 61754-7 interface 7-3, the MPO adapter interface, and shall
optically mate with the plug on the optical fiber cabling. Several cage to bezel options
are defined. Both metal spring finger and elastomeric EMI solutions are permitted but
must pass customer defined requirements. Heat sink/clip thermal designs are application
specific and not specifically defined by this specification, however a general design is
given as an example.

5.2 QSFP+ Datums and Component Alignment
A listing of the datums for the various components is contained in Table 8. The
alignments of some of the datums are noted. The relationship of the Module, Cage, and
Connector relative to the Host Board and Bezel is illustrated in Figure 7 by the location
of the key datums of each of the components. In order to reduce the complexity of the
drawings, all dimensions are considered centered unless otherwise specified.

5.3 QSFP+ Module Mechanical Package Dimensions
A common mechanical outline is used for all QSFP+ Modules and direct attach cables. The
preferred method of removing the module from the cage assembly is by a bail type
actuation method. The module shall provide a means to self-lock with the cage upon
insertion. The package dimensions for the QSFP+ Module are defined in Figure 8 and Figure
9. The dimensions that control the size of the module that extends outside of the cage
are listed as maximum dimensions per Note 1 and Note 6 in Figure 8. Note: All dimensions
are in mm.

5.3.1       Mating of QSFP+ Module PCB to QSFP+ Electrical Connector
The QSFP+ Module contains a printed circuit board that mates with the QSFP+ electrical
connector. The pads are designed for a sequenced mating:

      First mate – ground contacts
      Second mate – power contacts
      Third mate – signal contacts

The pattern layout for the QSFP+ Printed Circuit Board is shown in Figure 10.

5.4.1 Insertion, Extraction and Retention Forces for QSFP+ Modules

The requirements for insertion forces, extraction forces and retention forces are
specified in Table 9. The QSFP+ cage and module design combinations must ensure excessive
force applied to a cable does not damage the QSFP+ cage or host connector. If any part is
damaged by excessive force, it should be the cable or media module and not the cage or
host connector which is part of the host system.

5.5 Color Coding and Labeling of QSFP+ Modules
An exposed feature of the QSFP+ Module (a feature or surface extending outside of the
bezel) shall be color coded as follows:

      Beige for 850nm
      Blue for 1310nm
      White for 1550nm

Each QSFP+ Module shall be clearly labeled. The complete labeling need not be visible
when the QSFP+ Module is installed and the bottom of the device is the recommended
location for the label. Labeling shall include:

      Appropriate manufacturing and part number identification
      Appropriate regulatory compliance labeling
      A manufacturing traceability code

The label should also include clear specification of the external port characteristics
such as:

      Optical wavelength
      Required fiber characteristics
      Operating data rate
      Interface standards supported
      Link length supported

The labeling shall not interfere with the mechanical, thermal or EMI features.


5.6 Bezel for Systems Using QSFP+ Modules
Host enclosures that use QSFP+ devices should provide appropriate clearances between the
QSFP+ Modules to allow insertion and extraction without the use of special tools and a
bezel enclosure with sufficient mechanical strength. The QSFP+ Module insertion slot
should be clear of nearby moldings and covers that might block convenient access to the
latching mechanisms, the QSFP+ Module, or the cables that plug directly into the cage.

There are two cage designs defined for use with QSFP+ modules as described in sub-clauses
5.6.1 and 5.6.2. The difference between them is that the front of one cage extends into


QSFP+ 4X 10 GB/S Pluggable Transceiver                                             Page 32

or through the opening in the bezel and the other extends up against the back surface of
the bezel. While the cage footprint is the same for both designs, its distance from the
inside surface of the host bezel may differ depending on gasket selection. The
recommended basic dimension from the inside surface of the bezel to Datum K and Datum L
on the Host board may be different between designs and is addressed in Figures 13a and
13b.

These designs align with the two versions for cage assemblies as defined in Section 5.8.
The minimum recommended host board thickness for belly-to-belly mounting of the
assemblies is different for each bezel version as noted in 5.6.1 and 5.6.2.

The bezel thickness range shall be 0.8 mm to 2.6 mm.


5.6.1 Bezel for the Thru Bezel Cage Assembly Version
The front surface of the cage assembly passes through the bezel.

Two EMI solutions may be implemented for this option. If EMI spring fingers are used,
they make contact to the inside of the bezel cutouts. If an EMI gasket is used, it makes
contact to the inside surface of the bezel. To accept all cage designs, both bezel
surfaces must be conductive and connected to chassis ground.

The minimum recommended host board thickness for belly to belly mounting of the connector
and cage assemblies is 2.2mm minimum.

5.6.2 Bezel for the Behind the Bezel Cage Assembly Version
There are many options for a bezel EMI gasket that functions as a seal between the bezel
and the front of the cage. The design of the bezel EMI gasket and the materials used for
the gasket are application specific. The preferred method is to fasten the gasket to the
back of the bezel with a pressure sensitive adhesive.

Assembly of the host board to the bezel will compress the gasket to the recommended range
specified by the bezel EMI gasket manufacturer. The surface in the back of the bezel that
is in contact with the bezel EMI gasket must be low resistance and connected to chassis
ground. The minimum recommended host board thickness for belly to belly mounting of the
connector and cage assemblies are 2.7mm minimum.

The gasket thickness after compression can be calculated as follows:

         GT = BKL – 42.80 +/- 0.25mm.

Where:

• GT is gasket thickness in the compressed state.
• BKL is the distance from the back of the bezel to the centerline of Datums K & L. See
Figure 11 and Figure 12 (Note: dimension from front of bezel to centerline of Datums K &
L must not exceed 48.25mm).
• The 42.80 +/- 0.25mm dimension is the distance from the front of the cage to the hard
stop, Datum T. See Figure 17.

5.8.1 QSFP+ Heat Sink Clip Dimensions
The heat sink clip defined in Figure 18 is for reference only. The design of the heat
sink clip, heat sink and their attachment features on the cage assembly are vendor
specific and not defined in this document. When fastened to the cage, the clip will
provide a minimum force of 5 Newtons at the interface of the heat sink and QSFP+ Module.
The clip is designed to permit a heat sink to be fastened into the clip then assembled to
the cage and to expand slightly during module insertion in order to maintain a contact
force between the module and heat sink.

5.8.2 QSFP+ Heat Sink Dimensions
The heat sink illustrated in Figure 19 is for reference only. Critical dimensions to
ensure that the heat sink will be compatible with the Heat Sink Clip are defined. The
configuration of the fins or posts is application specific along with the outside
envelope. The heat sink includes a beveled edge which “rides up” the leading edge of the
module as the module is inserted into the cage assembly. The recommended material for the
heat sink is aluminum and the surface treatment for the module contacting surface can be
anodizing or nickel plating.

5.9 Dust / EMI Cover
In order to prevent contamination of the internal components and to optimize EMI
performance, it is recommended that a Dust/EMI Cover be inserted into the cage assembly
when no module is present. See Figure 19 for the recommended design. During installation,
the front flange on the cover shall be seated against the front surface of the bezel to
prevent dust from entering the equipment. The conductivity of the materials should be
chosen for the Dust/EMI Cover to block EMI emissions.

6 Environmental and Thermal

6.1 Thermal Requirements
The QSFP+ module shall operate within one or more of the case temperatures ranges defined
in Table 10. The temperature ranges are applicable between 60m below sea level and 1800m
above sea level, (Ref. NEBS GR-63) utilizing the host systems designed airflow.

            Industrial                          -40 through 85C

QSFP+ is designed to allow for up to 16 adjacent modules, ganged and/or belly-to-belly,
with the appropriate thermal design for cooling / airflow. (Ref. NEBS GR-63)



7 Management Interface

7.1 Introduction
A management interface, as already commonly used in other form factors like GBIC, SFP,
and XFP, is specified in order to enable flexible use of the module by the user. The
specification has been changed in order to adopt the use of a multi-channel module. Some
timing requirements are critical especially for a multi-channel device, so the interface
speed has been increased. This QSFP+ specification is based on the INF8438 specification
however it is not backward compatible.   Address 128 Page00 is used to indicate the use
of the QSFP+ memory map rather than the QSFP memory map.

7.2 Timing Specification

7.2.1 Introduction
Low speed signaling is based on Low Voltage CMOS (LVCMOS) operating at Vcc. Hosts shall
use a pull-up resistor connected to a Vcc_host on the 2-wire interface SCL (clock) and
SDA (Data) signals. Detailed electrical specification is given in Sub-clause 4.1.2.
Nomenclature for all registers more than 1 bit long is MSB-LSB.


7.2.2 Management Interface Timing Specification
In order to support a multi-channel device a higher clock rate for the serial interface
is considered. The timing requirements are shown in Figure 22 and specified in Table 11.
QSFP+ is positioned to leverage 2-wire timing (Fast Mode devices) to align the use of
related cores on host ASICs. This subclause closely follows the XFP MSA specification.

                             Figure 22 — QSFP+ Timing Diagram

Before initiating a 2-wire serial bus communication, the host shall provide setup time
(Host_select_setup -Table 11) on the ModSelL line of all modules on the 2-wire bus. The
host shall not change the ModSelL line of any module until the 2-wire serial bus
communication is complete and the hold time requirement (Host_select_hold - Table 11) is
satisfied. The 2-wire serial interface address of the QSFP+ module is 1010000X (A0h). In
order to allow access to multiple QSFP+ modules on the same 2-wire serial bus, the QSFP+
pinout includes a ModSelL or module select pin. This pin (which is pulled high or
deselected in the module) must be held low by the host to select the module of interest
and allow communication over the 2-wire serial interface. The module must not respond to
or accept 2-wire serial bus instructions unless it is selected.


7.2.3 Serial Interface Protocol
The module asserts LOW for clock stretch on SCL.

   Note 1: Measured from falling clock edge after stop bit of write transaction


7.4 Device Addressing and Operation
Serial Clock (SCL): The host supplied SCL input to QSFP+ Modules is used to positive-edge
clock data into each QSFP+ device and negative-edge clock data out of each device. The
SCL line may be pulled low by a QSFP+ module during clock stretching.

Serial Data (SDA): The SDA pin is bi-directional for serial data transfer. This pin is
open-drain or open-collector driven and may be wire-ORed with any number of open-drain or
open collector devices. Master/Slave: QSFP+ Modules operate only as slave devices. The
host must provide a bus master for SCL and initiate all read/write communication.

Device Address: Each QSFP+ is hard wired at the device address A0h. See Subclause 7.6 for
memory structure within each Module.

Multiple Devices per SCL/SDA: While QSFP+ Modules are compatible with point-to-point
SCL/SDA, they can share a single SCL/SDA bus by using the QSFP+ ModSelL line. See
Subclause 4.1.1.1,Subclause 4.1.2 and Table 3 for more information.

Clock and Data Transitions: The SDA pin is normally pulled high with an external device.
Data on the SDA pin may change only during SCL low time periods. Data changes during SCL
high periods indicate a START or STOP condition. All addresses and data words are
serially transmitted to and from the QSFP+ in 8-bit words.

QSFP+ 4X 10 GB/S Pluggable Transceiver                                            Page 49
PUBLISHED                                                                 SFF-8436 Rev 4.9


Every byte on the SDA line must be 8-bits long. Data is transferred with the most
significant bit (MSB) first. START Condition: A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL
high is a START condition, which must precede any other command.

STOP Condition: A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a STOP condition.
Acknowledge: After sending each 8-bit word, the transmitter releases the SDA line for one
bit time, during which the receiver is allowed to pull SDA low (zero) to acknowledge
(ACK) that it has received each word.

Device address bytes and write data bytes initiated by the host shall be acknowledged by
QSFP+ Modules. Read data bytes transmitted by QSFP+ Modules shall be acknowledged by the
host for all but the final byte read, for which the host shall respond with a STOP
instead of an ACK.

Memory (Management Interface) Reset: After an interruption in protocol, power loss or
system reset the QSFP+ management interface can be reset. Memory reset is intended only
to reset the QSFP+ Module management interface (to correct a hung bus). No other module
functionality is implied.

1) Clock up to 9 cycles.
2) Look for SDA high in each cycle while SCL is high.
3) Create a START condition as SDA is high

Device Addressing: QSFP+ devices require an 8-bit device address word following a start
condition to enable a read or write operation. The device address word consists of a
mandatory sequence for the first seven most significant bits in Figure 23. This is common
to all QSFP+ devices.

            1     0        1          0        0         0        0      R/W
            MSB                                                          LSB
                               Figure 23 – QSFP+ Device Address

The eighth bit of the device address is the read/write operating select bit. A read
operation is initiated if this bit is set high and a write operation is initiated if this
bit is set low. Upon compare of the device address (with ModSelL in the low state) the
QSFP+ Module shall output a zero (ACK) on the SDA line to acknowledge the address.

7.5 Read/Write Functionality

7.5.1 QSFP+ Memory Address Counter (Read AND Write Operations)
QSFP+ devices maintain an internal data word address counter containing the last address
accessed during the latest read or write operation, incremented by one. The address
counter is incremented whenever a data word is received or sent by the module. This
address stays valid between operations as long as QSFP+ power is maintained. The address
“roll over” during read and writes operations is from the last byte of the 128-byte
memory page to the first byte of the same page.

7.5.2 Read Operations

7.5.2.1 Current Address Read
A current address read operation requires only the device address read word (10100001) be
sent, see Figure 24.

Once acknowledged by the QSFP+, the current address data word is serially clocked out.
The host does not respond with an acknowledge, but does generate a STOP condition once
the data word is read.

7.5.2.2 Random Read
A random read operation requires a “dummy” write operation to load in the target byte
address as shown in Figure 25. This is accomplished by the following sequence.

The target 8-bit data word address is sent following the device address write word
(10100000) and acknowledged by the QSFP+. The host then generates another START condition
(aborting the dummy write without incrementing the counter) and a current address read by
sending a device read address (10100001). The QSFP+ acknowledges the device address and
serially clocks out the requested data word. The host does not respond with an
acknowledge, but does generate a STOP condition once the data word is read.

7.5.2.3 Sequential Read
Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read Figure 26 or a random
address read Figure 27. To specify a sequential read, the host responds with an
acknowledge (instead of a STOP) after each data word. As long as the QSFP+ receives an
acknowledge, it shall serially clock out sequential data words. The sequence is
terminated when the host responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge.

7.5.3    Write Operations

word (10100000) and acknowledgement, see Figure 28.

Upon receipt of this address, the QSFP+ shall again respond with a zero (ACK) to
acknowledge and then clock in the first 8-bit data word. Following the receipt of the 8-
bit data word, the QSFP+ shall output a zero (ACK) and the host master must terminate the
write sequence with a STOP condition for the write cycle to begin. If a START condition
is sent in place of a STOP condition (i.e. a repeated START per the 2-wire interface
specification) the write is aborted and the data received during that operation is
discarded. Upon receipt of the proper STOP condition, the QSFP+ enters an internally
timed write cycle, tWR, to internal memory. The QSFP+ disables its management interface
input during this write cycle and shall not respond or acknowledge subsequent commands
until the write is complete. Note that 2-wire interface “Combined Format” using repeated
START conditions is not supported on QSFP+ write commands.

QSFP+’s shall support up to a 4 sequential byte write without repeatedly sending QSFP+
address and memory address information as shown in Figure 29.

                                  Figure 29 - QSFP+ Sequential Write Operation

A “sequential” write is initiated the same way as a single byte write, but the host
master does not send a stop condition after the first word is clocked in. Instead, after
the QSFP+ acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the host can transmit up to three
more data words. The QSFP+ shall send an acknowledge after each data word received. The
host must terminate the sequential write sequence with a STOP condition or the write
operation shall be aborted and data discarded. Note that 2-wire interface “combined
format” using repeated START conditions is not supported on QSFP+ write commands.

7.5.3.3 Acknowledge Polling
Once the QSFP+ internally timed write cycle has begun (and inputs are being ignored on
the bus) acknowledge polling can be used to determine when the write operation is
complete. This involves sending a START condition followed by the device address word.
Only if the internal write cycle is complete shall the QSFP+ respond with an acknowledge
to subsequent commands, indicating read or write operations can continue.


7.6 QSFP+ Memory Map
This subclause defines the Memory Map for QSFP+ Module used for serial ID, digital
monitoring and certain control functions. The interface is mandatory for all QSFP+
devices. The interface has been designed largely after the XFP MSA as defined in INF-
8077i Rev.4.0. The memory map has been changed in order to accommodate 4 optical channels
and limit the required memory space. The single address approach is used as found in XFP.
Paging is used in order to enable time critical interactions between host and Module.

The structure of the memory is shown in Figure 30. The memory space is arranged into a
lower, single page, address space of 128 bytes and multiple upper address space pages.
This structure permits timely access to addresses in the lower page, e.g. Interrupt Flags
and Monitors. Less time critical entries, e.g. serial ID information and threshold
settings, are available with the Page Select function. The structure also provides
address expansion by adding additional upper pages as needed. For example, in Figure 30
upper pages 01 and 02 are optional. Upper page 01 allows implementation of Application
Select Table, and upper page 02 provides user read/write space. The lower page and upper
page 00 are always implemented. Page 03 is required if byte 2, bit 2 in the lower page
is low. See Table 39 for details regarding declaration of optional upper pages 01 and
02.

The interface address used is A0xh and is mainly used for time critical data like
interrupt handling in order to enable a “one-time-read” for all data related to an
interrupt situation. After an Interrupt, IntL, has been asserted, the host can read out
the flag field to determine the effected channel and type of flag.

In order to allow access to multiple QSFP+ Modules on the same 2-wire serial interface,
the QSFP+ pinout includes a ModSelL pin which allows the host to select the respective
Module for interaction. See Subclause 4.1.1.1 for details on ModSelL and Subclause 4.1.2
for details of the 2-Wire serial interface.

Note: Reserved memory locations are to be filled with logic zeros in all bit locations
for reserved bytes, and in reserved bit locations for partially specified byte locations
as described in this clause. Optional bits (O) that are not being used are to be filled
with logic zeros. Not Applicable bits (NA) shall be filled with logic zeros. The
indications of Optional (O), Required (R) and Not Applicable (NA) registers are shown in
each table for the appropriate cable types.

7.6.1 Lower Memory Map
The lower 128 bytes of the 2-wire serial bus address space, see Table 17, is used to
access a variety of measurements and diagnostic functions, a set of control functions,
and a means to select which of the various upper memory map pages are accessed on
subsequent reads. This portion of the address space is always directly addressable and
thus is chosen for monitoring and control functions that may need to be repeatedly
accessed. The definition of Identifier field is the same as page 00h Address Byte 128.

                                         ready to be read
                                         at which time the
                                         device sets the
                                         bit low.


The Data_Not_Ready bit is high during module power up and prior to a valid suite of
monitor readings. Once all monitor readings are valid, the bit is set low until the
device is powered down. If the memory contents are static this bit can be always low.


7.6.1.2 Interrupt Flags
A portion of the memory map (Bytes 3 through 21), form a flag field. Within this field,
the status of LOS and Tx Fault as well as alarms and warnings for the various monitored
items is reported. For normal operation and default state, the bits in this field have
the value of 0b. For the defined conditions of LOS, Tx Fault, module and channel alarms
and warnings, the appropriate bit or bits are set, value = 1b. Once asserted, the bits
remained set (latched) until cleared by a read operation that includes the affected bit
or reset by the ResetL pin.

Fault bits that are cleared while the underlying fault persists MAY be immediately set
again by the module. This may or may not cause the IntL to de-assert and then re-assert
quickly. Hosts should be tolerant of both behaviors. The Channel Status Interrupt Flags
are defined in Table 19. These flags may be masked. (See 7.6.1.6)

7.6.1.3 Module Monitors
Real time monitoring for the QSFP+ module include Module temperature, Module supply
voltage, and monitoring for each transmit and receive channel. Channel monitoring
functions are described in Subclause 7.6.1.4.

Measured parameters are reported in 16-bit data fields, i.e., two concatenated bytes.
These are shown in Table 22. The 16 bit-data fields allow for wide dynamic range. This
is not intended to imply that a 16-bit A/D system is recommended or required in order to
achieve the accuracy goals stated below. The width of the data field should not be taken
to imply a given level of precision. It is conceivable that the accuracy goals herein
can be achieved by a system having less than 16 bits of resolution. It is recommended
that any low-order data bits beyond the system’s specified accuracy be fixed at zero.
Overall system accuracy and precision will be vendor dependent.

To guarantee coherency of the diagnostic monitoring data, the host is required to
retrieve any multi-byte fields from the diagnostic monitoring data structure by the use
of a single two-byte read sequence across the 2-wire serial interface. The Module is
required to insure that any multi-byte fields that are updated with diagnostic monitoring
data must have this update done in a fashion that guarantees coherency and consistency of
the data.

In other words, the update of a multi-byte field by the Module must not occur such that a
partially updated multi-byte field can be transferred to the host. Also, the Module
shall not update a multi-byte field within the structure during the transfer of that
multi-byte field to the host, such that partially updated data would be transferred to
the host.
Accuracy requirements specified below shall apply to the operating signal range specified
in the relevant standard. The manufacturer’s specification should be consulted for more
detail on the conditions under which the accuracy requirements are met.

Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage and
should be interpreted as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values should be
interpreted in the same manner as real time 16-bit data.

Internally measured Module temperature are represented as a 16-bit signed twos complement
value in increments of 1/256 degrees Celsius, yielding a total range of –128C to +128C
that is considered valid between –40 and +125C. Temperature accuracy is vendor specific
but must be better than ±3 degrees Celsius over specified operating temperature and
voltage. Please see vendor specification for details on location of temperature sensor.

Internally measured Module supply voltage are represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer
with the voltage defined as the full 16 bit value (0 – 65535) with LSB equal to 100
uVolt, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to +6.55 Volts. Practical considerations
to be defined by Module manufacturer will tend to limit the actual bounds of the supply
voltage measurement. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than ±3% of the
manufacturer’s nominal value over specified operating temperature and voltage.

7.6.1.4 Channel Monitoring
Real time channel monitoring is for each transmit and receive channel and includes
optical input power and Tx bias current. Module monitoring functions are described in
Subclause 7.6.1.3.

Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage and
should be interpreted as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values should be
interpreted in the same manner as real time 16-bit data. Table 23 defines the Channel
Monitoring.

Measured TX bias current is in mA and are represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with
the current defined as the full 16 bit value (0 – 65535) with LSB equal to 2 uA, yielding
a total measurement range of 0 to 131 mA. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better
than ±10% of the manufacturer’s nominal value over specified operating temperature and
voltage.

Measured RX received optical power is in mW and can represent either average received
power or OMA depending upon how bit 3 of byte 220 (upper memory page 00h) is set.
Represented as a 16 bit unsigned integer with the power defined as the full 16 bit value
(0 – 65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 uW, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to 6.5535
mW (~-40 to +8.2 dBm). Absolute accuracy is dependent upon the exact optical wavelength.

For the vendor specified wavelength, accuracy shall be better than ±3 dB over specified
temperature and voltage. This accuracy shall be maintained for input power levels up to
the lesser of maximum transmitted or maximum received optical power per the appropriate
standard. It shall be maintained down to the minimum transmitted power minus cable plant
loss (insertion loss or passive loss) per the appropriate standard. Absolute accuracy
beyond this minimum required received input optical power range is vendor specific.

If software Rate Select is not implemented, the Module ignores the value of Rate Select
bits. The registers read all “0”s upon power-up.


7.6.1.6 Module and Channel Masks
The host system may control which flags result in an interrupt (IntL) by setting high
individual bits from a set of masking bits in bytes 100-104 for module flags, and bytes
242-253 of page 03h for channel flags. These are described in Table 25 and Table 48. A
1 value in a masking bit prevents the assertion of the hardware IntL pin by the
corresponding latched flag bit. Masking bits are volatile and startup with all unmasked
(masking bits 0).

The mask bits may be used to prevent continued interruption from on-going conditions,
which would otherwise continually reassert the hardware IntL pin. A mask bit is required
(indicated by C for Conditional) whenever the associated flag bit is implemented.

7.6.1.7 Rate Select (Byte 87-88)
Rate Select is an optional control used to limit the receiver bandwidth for compatibility
with multiple data rates (most likely Fibre Channel). In addition, rate selection allows
the transmitter to be fine-tuned for specific data rate transmissions.

The Module may:

a)     Provide no support for rate selection
b)     Rate selection using extended rate select
c)     Rate selection with application select tables


7.6.1.7.1 No Rate Selection Support
When no rate selection is supported, (page 00h, byte 221, bits 2 and 3) have a value of 0
and Options (page 00h, byte 195, bit 5) have a value of 0. Lack of implementation does
not indicate lack of simultaneous compliance with multiple standard rates. Compliance
with particular standards should be determined from Module Values (See Table 33).


7.6.1.7.2 Extended Rate Selection

least one of the bits in the Extended Rate Compliance byte (page 00h, byte 141) have a

7.6.1.7.3 Rate Selection Using Application Select Tables
Application Select(byte 89) maximizes compatibility with SFF-8079 Part 2 for Modules that
are SFF-8472 compliant.

When the Rate Select declaration bits (page 00h, byte 221, bits 2 and 3) have the values
of 1 and 0 respectively, the Application Select method defined in Page 01h is used (see
Subclause 7.6.3).

The host reads the entire application select table on page 01h to determine the
capabilities of the Module. The host controls each channel separately by writing a
Control Mode and Table Select (TS) byte to bytes 89-92 and bytes 94-97. The bits of the
Rx_Application Select and the Tx_Application Select registers are defined in Table 27.

                           Table 27--Definition of Application Select
                         (Bytes 89 to 92 and Bytes 94 to 97) (Page A0)

Control Mode defines the application control mode. Table Select selects module behavior
from the AST among 63 possibilities (000000 to 111110). Note that (111111) is invalid.

7.6.1.8 Password Entry and change
Bytes 119-126 are reserved for an optional password entry function. The Password entry
bytes are write only and will be retained until power down, reset, or rewritten by host.
This function may be used to control read/write access to vendor specific page 02h.
Additionally, module vendors may use this function to implement write protection of
Serial ID and other QSFP+ read only information. Passwords may be supplied to and used by
Host manufacturers to limit write access in the User EEPROM Page 02h.

Password access shall not be required to access QSFP+ defined data in the lower memory
page 00h or in upper pages 00h, 02h and 03h. Note that multiple module manufacturer
passwords may be defined to allow selective access to read or write to various sections
of memory as allowed above.

Host manufacturer and module manufacturer passwords shall be distinguished by the high
order bit (bit 7, byte 123). All host manufacturer passwords shall fall in the range of
00000000h to 7FFFFFFFh, and all module manufacturer passwords in the range of 80000000h
to FFFFFFFFh. Host manufacturer passwords shall be initially set to 00001011h in new
modules.

Host manufacturer passwords may be changed by writing a new password in bytes 119-122
when the correct current Host manufacture password has been entered in 123-126, with the
high order bit being ignored and forced to a value of 0 in the new password.
The password entry field shall be set to 00000000h on power up and reset.

7.6.2 Upper Memory Map Page 00h
Page 00h consists of the Serial ID and is used for read only identification information.
The Serial ID is divided into the Base_ID Fields, Extended ID Fields and Vendor Specific
ID Fields. The format of the Serial ID Memory Map is shown in Table 29.

The nominal bit rate (BR, nominal) is specified in units of 100 Megabits per second,
rounded off to the nearest 100 Megabits per second. The bit rate includes those bits
necessary to encode and delimit the signal as well as those bits carrying data
information. A value of 0 indicates that the bit rate is not specified and must be
determined from the Module technology. The actual information transfer rate will depend
on the encoding of the data, as defined by the encoding value.

7.6.2.16 Vendor OUI (Address 165-167)
The vendor organizationally unique identifier field (vendor OUI) is a 3-byte field that
contains the IEEE Company Identifier for the vendor. A value of all zero in the 3-byte
field indicates that the Vendor OUI is unspecified.


7.6.2.17 Vendor PN (Address 168-183)
The vendor part number (vendor PN) is a 16-byte field that contains ASCII characters,
left aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining the vendor part
number or product name. A value of all zero in the 16-byte field indicates that the
vendor PN is unspecified.


7.6.2.18 Vendor Rev (Address 184-185)
The vendor revision number (vendor rev) is a 2-byte field that contains ASCII characters,
left aligned and padded on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining the vendor’s
product revision number. A value of all zero in the field indicates that the vendor Rev
is unspecified.


7.6.2.19 Wavelength (Address 186-187)
Nominal transmitter output wavelength at room temperature. 16 bit hex value with byte 186
as high order byte and byte 187 as low order byte. The laser wavelength is equal to the
16 bit integer value divided by 20 in nm (units of 0.05nm). This resolution should be
adequate to cover all relevant wavelengths yet provide enough resolution for all expected
DWDM applications. For accurate representation of controlled wavelength applications,
this value should represent the center of the guaranteed wavelength range.

If the cable is identified as copper these registers will be used to define the cable
attenuation. An indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the case where the
attenuation is not known or is unavailable.

Address 186 (00-FFh) is an 8 bit hex value indicating the copper cable attenuation at
2.5GHz in units of 1 dB

Address 187 (00-FFh) is an 8 bit hex value indicating the copper cable attenuation at
5.0GHz in units of 1 db.


7.6.2.20 Wavelength Tolerance (Address 188-189)
The guaranteed +/- range of transmitter output wavelength under all normal operating
conditions. For direct attach cable assemblies the value is zero. 16 bit value with byte
188 as high order byte and byte 189 as low order byte. The laser wavelength is equal to
the 16 bit integer value divided by 200 in nm (units of 0.005nm). Thus, the following two
examples:

Example 1:

10GBASE-LR Wavelength Range = 1260 to 1355 nm
Nominal Wavelength in bytes 186 - 187 = 1307.5 nm.
Represented as INT(1307.5 nm * 20) = 26150 = 6626h
Wavelength Tolerance in bytes 188 - 189 = 47.5nm.
Represented as INT(47.5 nm * 200) = 9500 = 251Ch

Example 2:

ITU-T Grid Wavelength = 1534.25 nm (195.4 THz) with 0.236 nm ( 30 GHz) Tolerance
Nominal Wavelength in bytes 186 - 187 = 1534.25 nm.

“Diagnostic Monitoring Type” is a 1-byte field with 8 single bit indicators describing
how diagnostic monitoring is implemented in the particular QSFP+ Module. Bit indicators
are shown in Table 41.

Digital Diagnostic Monitors monitor received power, bias current, supply voltage and
temperature. Additionally, alarm and warning thresholds must be written as specified in
this document. Auxiliary monitoring fields are optional extensions to Digital
Diagnostics.

All digital monitoring values must be internally calibrated and reported in the units
defined in this document.

Bit 3 indicates whether the received power measurement represents average input optical
power or OMA. If the bit is set, average power is monitored. If not, OMA is monitored.

is optional or indicated by an R where the monitor is required. Warning thresholds, High
and Low are optional. These factory-preset values allow the user to determine when a
particular value is outside of “normal” limits as determined by the Module manufacturer.
It is assumed that these values will vary with different technologies and different
implementations.

The values reported in the Alarm and Warning Thresholds area may be typical values at
some chosen nominal operating conditions and may be temperature compensated or otherwise
adjusted when setting warning and/or alarm flags. Any threshold compensation or
adjustment is vendor specific and optional. Refer to the vendor’s data sheet for use of
alarm and warning thresholds.

Squelch disable and output control functionality are optional; if implemented, squelch
disable and output disable are controlled for each channel using bytes 240 and 241 of
page 03h. Squelch is normally operational as described in Subclause 4.1.3, High Speed
Electrical Specification. Writing a “1” in the Squelch Disable register (byte 240, page
03h) disables the squelch for the associated channel. Writing a “1” in the Output
Disable register (byte 241, page 03h) squelches the output of the associated channel.
When a “1” is written in both registers for a channel, the associated output is disabled.
The registers read all “0”s upon power-up.

The Masking Bits for the Channel Monitor Functions are defined in Table 49.    A mask bit
is required whenever a monitor and associated flag is implemented.
