2.4 Conventions
The following conventions are used throughout this document:

DEFINITIONS: Certain words and terms used in this standard have a specific meaning beyond the normal English
meaning. These words and terms are defined either in the definitions or in the text where they first appear.

ORDER OF PRECEDENCE: If a conflict arises between text, tables, or figures, the order of precedence to resolve
the conflicts is text; then tables; and finally figures. Not all tables or figures are fully described in the text. Tables
show data format and values.

NUMBERING CONVENTIONS: The ISO convention of numbering is used (i.e., the thousands and higher multiples

  5. Compliance boards and reference points
The module electrical interface test points are intended to be measured using compliance boards as shown in Figure
5-1. These compliance boards are intended to connect the module under test to test equipment for verification of
compliance to the appropriate standard. The Module Compliance Board is used to test the module. The electrical
parameters of the compliance boards should be specified by the appropriate standard. The Module Compliance
Board and Host Compliance Board can be plugged together for calibration of compliance signals and to check the
electrical parameters of the compliance boards. Reference points are described in Table 5-1.

  6. Electrical Specification
This chapter contains pad definition data for the module. The pad definition data is generic for high speed datacom
applications such as Fibre Channel, Ethernet and SONET/ATM. Reference points for high-speed electrical
measurements are defined in Table 5-1 and illustrated in Figure 5-1. Reference points for all other electrical signals
are at comparable points at the host card edge connector.

6.1 Electrical Connector
Figure 6-1 shows the signal symbols and pad numbering for the module edge connector. The diagram shows the
module PCB edge as a top and bottom view, where bottom is nearer the host PCB. There are 38 pads intended for
high speed signals, low speed signals, power and ground connections. Color green identifies ground pads, color
red identifies power pads, color orange identifies low speed signal/control pads, and color blue identifies high speed
I/O pads. Table 6-1 provides more information about each of the 38 pads.


The module contains a printed circuit board that mates with the electrical connector. The pads are designed for a
sequenced mating:

        Connected first, disconnected last:                - ground contacts
        Connected second, disconnected second:             - power contacts
        Connected third, disconnected first:               - signal contacts
For EMI protection the signals to the connector should be shut off when the module is absent. Standard board
layout practices such as connections to Vcc and GND with vias, the use of short and equal-length differential signal
lines, and the use of microstrip-lines and 50 Ω terminations are recommended. The chassis ground (case common)
of the module should be isolated from the module's circuit ground, GND, to provide the equipment designer
flexibility regarding connections between external electromagnetic interference shields and circuit ground, GND, of
the module.

Note 1: GND is the symbol for signal and supply (power) common for the module. All are common within the
module and all module voltages are referenced to this potential unless otherwise noted. Connect these directly to
the host board signal-common ground plane.
For QSFP2, each connector GND contact is rated for a maximum current of 500 mA.
Note 2: VccRx, Vcc1 and VccTx are applied concurrently and may be internally connected within the module in any
combination. Vcc contacts in SFF-8662 and SFF-8672 each have a steady state current rating of 1000 mA.
For QSFP2, each connector Vcc contact is rated for a maximum current of 1500 mA.
For Power Classes 4 and above the module differential loading of input voltage pads must not result in exceeding
contact current limits.

6.3 Low Speed Signal Descriptions
In addition to the two-wire interface the module has the following low speed signals for control and status:

            •    ModSelL
            •    ResetL
            •    LPMode/TxDis
            •    ModPrsL
            •    IntL/RxLOSL

The behavior of these signals is given in 1 to 6.3.5, the electrical specifications are in 6.4.1, and timing requirements
are in 6.4.2 and Section 9. Timing requirements for the two-wire interface are in Appendix A.


6.3.1 ModSelL
ModSelL is an input signal. When held low by the host, the module responds to two-wire serial communication
commands. The ModSelL signal allows the use of multiple modules on a single two-wire interface. When ModSelL
is high, the module shall not respond to or acknowledge any two-wire interface communication from the host. The
ModSelL signal input node shall be pulled towards Vcc in the module.
In order to avoid conflicts, the host system shall not attempt two-wire interface communications within the ModSelL
hold time after any modules are deselected. Similarly, the host shall wait at least for the period of the ModSelL
setup time before communicating with the newly selected module. The assertion and de-assertion periods of
different modules may overlap as long as the above timing requirements are met.

6.3.2 ResetL
The ResetL signal shall be pulled towards Vcc in the module. A low level on ResetL for longer than the minimum
pulse length (t_Reset_init) initiates a complete module reset, returning all user module settings to their default
state. Module Reset Assert Time (t_init) starts on the rising edge after the low level of the ResetL pad is released.
During the execution of a reset (t_init) the host shall disregard all status bits until the module indicates a completion
of reset interrupt by asserting "low" on the IntL/RxLOSL signal (see SFF-8636 or CMIS for details). However, on
power up (including hot insertion) the module should post this completion of reset interrupt without the host pulling
ResetL low.

6.3.3 LPMode/TxDis
LPMode/TxDis is a dual-mode input signal from the host operating with active high logic. It shall be pulled towards
Vcc in the module. At power-up or after reset, LPMode/TxDis behaves as LPMode. If supported, LPMode/TxDis can
be configured as TxDis using the two-wire interface. TxDis provides an optional fast mode, see definition in SFF-
8636 or CMIS.

When LPMode/TxDis is configured as LPMode, the module behaves as though TxDis=0.

By using the LPMode signal and a combination of the Power_override, Power_set and High_Power_Class_Enable
software control bits (SFF-8636, Address A0h, Byte 93 bits 0,1,2), the host controls how much power a module can
consume. See CMIS Chapter 6.3.2 Module State Machine (MSM) on how LPMode is used in the control of the module
power mode in transceivers with CMIS implementation.

See section 6.6 for more details on the power supply specifications.

When LPMode/TxDis is configured as TxDis, the module behaves as though LPMode=0. In this mode
LPMode/TxDis when set to 1 or 0 disables or enables all optical transmitters within the times specified in Table 9-1.

Changing LPMode/TxDis mode from LPMode to TxDis when the LPMode/TxDis state is high disables all optical
transmitters. If the module was in low power mode, then the module transitions out of low power mode at the
same time. If the module is already in high power state (Power Override control bits) with transmitters already

enabled, the module shall disable all optical transmitters.

Changing the LPMode/TxDis mode from LPMode to TxDis when the LPMode/TxDis state is low, simply changes the
behavior of the mode of LPMode/TxDis. The behavior of the module depends on the Power Override control bits.

Timing requirements for LPMode/TxDis mode changes are found in Table 9-1.

Note that the “soft” functions of TxDis, LPMode, IntL and RxLOSL allow the host to poll or set these values over
the two-wire interface as an alternative to monitoring/setting signal values. Asserting either the “hard pin” or “soft
bit” (or both) for TxDis or LPMode results in that function being asserted.

6.3.4 ModPrsL
ModPrsL is pulled up towards VccHost on the host board and pulled towards ground in the module. ModPrsL is
pulled low when the module is inserted and released to high when the module is physically absent from the host
connector.

6.3.5 IntL/RxLOSL
IntL/RxLOSL is a dual-mode active-low, open-collector output signal from the module. It shall be pulled up towards
Vcc on the host board. At power-up or after ResetL is released to high, IntL/RxLOSL is configured as IntL. If
supported, IntL/RxLOSL can be optionally programmed as RxLOSL using the two-wire interface. Rx LOS and RxLOSL
timings, including an optional fast mode, are given in Table 9-1.

If IntL/RxLOSL is configured as IntL, a low indicates a change in module state, possible module operational
fault or a module condition that sets an unmasked flag as defined in SFF -8636 or CMIS. The source of the
IntL “low” can be read, cleared or masked using the two-wire interface. If the interrupt was after a
module reset and SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 2, bit 0 (Data_Not_Ready bit) is 0, then the module releases
IntL to high after the host has read the Data_Not_Ready bit. For all other interrupt causes, t he module
releases IntL to high after the host has read the flag associated with the cause of the interrupt.

If IntL/RxLOSL is configured as RxLOSL, a low indicates that there is a loss of received optical power on
at least one lane. “high” indicates that there is no loss of received optical power. Rx LOS and RxLOSL
timings, including an optional fast mode, are given in Table 9-1. The actual condition of loss of optical
receive power is specified by other governing documents . The module shall pull RxLOSL to low if any lane
in a multiple lane module or cable has a LOS condition and shall release RxLOSL to high only if no lane
has a LOS condition.

Timing requirements for IntL/RxLOSL mode change are found in Table 9-1. If the module has no interrupt flags
asserted (IntL/RxLOSL is high), there should be no change in IntL/RxLOSL states after the mode change.

6.4 Low Speed Signal Electrical Specifications
6.4.1 Low Speed Signaling
Low speed signaling other than SCL and SDA is based on Low Voltage TTL (LVTTL) operating at Vcc. Vcc refers to
the generic supply voltages of VccTx, VccRx, VccHost or Vcc1. Hosts shall use a pull-up toward VccHost on each of
the two-wire interface SCL (clock) and SDA (data), and on the two low speed module status outputs ModPrsL and
IntL/RxLOSL.

The SCL and SDA is a hot plug interface that may support a bus topology. During module insertion or removal, the
module may implement a pre-charge circuit which prevents corrupting data transfers from other modules that are
already using the bus.

Compliance with Table 6-2 provides compatibility between host bus masters and the two-wire interface.

6.4.2 Low Speed Signal Timing
Timing for SCL and SDA is defined in a management interface document, SFF-8636 or CMIS, and is duplicated in
Appendix A for convenience. The default clock rate is a maximum of 400 kHz. An option to support up to 1 MHz
clock rate may be advertised in CMIS memory Page 00h Byte 2 (MciMaxSpeed). Initially, the host uses the 400 kHz
clock rate, and does not switch to the higher data rate before it has established that it is supported by the module.

SFF-8636 and CMIS define tBUF timing, tWR timing, tNACK timing, tBPC timing.
Timing of the hardware control functions and ModSelL are specified in Table 9-1 and Table A-1.

6.5 High Speed Signal Electrical Specifications
For detailed electrical specifications for operation up to 29 GBd see e.g., IEEE Std 802.3 Annex 86A, Annex 83E,
Annex 120C, or Annex 120E; Fibre Channel FC-PI-6, FC-PI-7; OIF CEI; InfiniBand FDR, EDR and HDR specifications.
For detailed electrical specifications for operation up to 57.8 GBd see e.g., IEEE Std 802.3ck Annex 120G; OIF CEI;
FC-PI-8; InfiniBand NDR.
For detailed electrical specifications for operation up to 106.25 GBd see IEEE P802.3dj.

Partial or complete squelch requirements may be provided in the appropriate specification. Where the relevant
specification does not provide a requirement or a recommendation, the following subclauses shall apply.

6.5.1 Rxip and Rxin
Rxip and Rxin are module receiver data outputs. They are AC-coupled 100 Ω differential lines that should be
terminated with 100 Ω differentially at the host ASIC (SerDes). The AC coupling is inside the module and not
required on the host board.

Due to the possibility of insertion of legacy QSFP and QSFP+ modules into a host designed for higher speed
operation, it is recommended that the damage threshold of the host input be at least 1600 mV peak to peak
differential. When properly terminated, the differential voltage swing shall be less than or equal to 900 mVpp or as
defined by the relevant standard, or whichever is less.

Output squelch for loss of optical input signal, hereafter Rx Squelch, is required and shall function as follows. In
the event that the optical signal on any lane becomes less than or equal to the level required to assert LOS, then
the receiver data output for that lane shall be squelched or disabled and the associated RxLOS flag set. In the
squelched or disabled state output impedance levels are maintained while the differential voltage swing shall be
less than 50 mVpp or the value in the relevant standard.

In normal operation the default case has Rx Squelch active. Rx Squelch can be deactivated using Rx Squelch Disable
through the two-wire interface. Rx Squelch Disable is an optional function. For specific details refer to SFF-8636 or
CMIS.

6.5.2 Txip and Txin
Txip and Txin are module transmitter data inputs. They are AC-coupled 100 Ω differential lines with 100 Ω
differential terminations inside the module. The AC coupling is inside the module and not required on the host
board.

Due to the possibility of insertion of modules into a host designed for lower speed operation, the damage threshold
of the module input shall be at least 1600 mV peak to peak differential.

Output squelch, hereafter Tx Squelch, for loss of input signal from the host, hereafter Tx LOS, is an optional
function. Where implemented it shall function as follows. In the event that the input signal becomes less than 50
mVpp or the value in the relevant standard, then the transmitter optical output for that lane shall be squelched or
disabled and the associated TxLOS flag set. If multiple electrical input lanes are associated with the same optical
output lanes, the loss of any of the incoming electrical input lanes causes the optical output lane to be squelched.
Where squelched, the transmitter OMA shall be less than or equal to -26 dBm and when disabled the transmitter
power shall be less than or equal to -30 dBm or the value(s) defined by the relevant standard. For applications,
e.g. Ethernet, where the transmitter off condition is defined in terms of average power, disabling the transmitter is
recommended and for applications, e.g. InfiniBand, where the transmitter off condition is defined in terms of OMA,
squelching the transmitter is recommended.

In module operation, where Tx Squelch is implemented, the default case has Tx Squelch active. Tx Squelch can be
deactivated using Tx Squelch Disable through the two-wire interface. Tx Squelch Disable is an optional function.
For specific details refer to SFF-8636 or CMIS.

6.6 Power Supply Requirements
A host board together with the QSFP+ module(s) forms an integrated power system. The host supplies stable
power to the module. The module limits electrical noise coupled back into the host system and limits inrush
charge/current during hot plug insertion or module state transitions.

The circuit card in a QSFP+ module has three designated power pads, designated VccTx, VccRx and Vcc1. When
the QSFP+ module is "hot plugged" into a connector with power already present, the three pads have power applied
concurrently. The module is responsible for limiting the inrush current surge from the reference power supply
filtering circuit during a hot plug event. The host power supply may supply up to the maximum inrush current limits
during a hot plug event without causing disturbance to other modules and components on the same power supply.

All specifications shall be met at the maximum power supply current. No power sequencing of the power supply is
required of the host system. The module sequences the contacts in the order of ground, supply and signals during
insertion.

6.6.1 Host Board Power Supply Filtering
The host board should use a power supply filtering network equivalent to that shown in Figure 6-5 .

                                                                   1 µH

                              GND




                       Figure 6-5 Recommended Host Board Power Supply Filtering
Any voltage drop across a filter network on the host is counted against the host DC set point accuracy specification.
System designers should choose components with appropriate DCR and ESR, in order to minimize the voltage drop
and the amount of noise coupled to the module. Inductors with DC resistance of less than 0.1 Ω should be used in
order to maintain the required voltage at the host edge card connector. It is recommended that the 22 μF capacitors
each have an equivalent series resistance of 0.22 Ω.

The specification of the host power supply filtering network is beyond the scope of this specification, particularly
because of the wide range of QSFP+ module power classes. An example current waveform into a host filter, labeled
I1 in Figure 6-6 is plotted in Figure 6-7. Each power connection has a supply filter for reducing high frequency noise
and ripple from host-to-module. During a hot-plug event, the filter network limits any voltage drop on the host
supply so that neighboring modules sharing the same supply stay within their specified supply voltage limits.

6.6.2 Power Classes and Maximum Power Consumption
The Module Power Mode dictates the maximum power that the module is permitted to consume. The Module Power
Mode is a function of the state of the Module State Machine. Two Module Power Modes are defined: Low Power
Mode and High Power Mode. The maximum module power consumption in Low Power Mode for QSFP+ is 1.5W.
The maximum module power consumption in High Power Mode is shown in Table 6-3.

Since different classes of modules exist with pre-defined maximum power consumption limits, it is necessary to
avoid exceeding the host power supply limits and cooling capacity when a module is inserted into a host designed
to use only lower power modules. It is recommended that the host, through the management interface, identify
the power consumption class of the module before allowing the module to go into High Power Mode.

All modules initially boot in Low Power Mode, while the module is transitioning through the initialization state.
QSFP+ modules are categorized into several power classes as listed in Table 6-3. Power classes are advertised in
SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 129 or CMIS, Page 00h, Byte 200. The maximum power consumption may be advertised
in SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 107 or CMIS, Page 00h, Byte 201.

                    in SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 107 or CMIS, Page 00h, Byte 201. Maximum power is
                    limited by current rating of power supply pins.



In order to avoid exceeding the host system power capacity and thermal management, upon hot-plug, power cycle
or reset, all QSFP+ modules shall power up as if they were Power Class 1, designated as "Low Power Mode".
QSFP+ modules that are Power Class 1 are fully functional after initialization and remain in Low Power Mode during
operation. All other QSFP+ modules reach fully functional operation only after the host system enables “High Power
Mode".

High Power Mode is defined as the power class advertised in SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 129 or CMIS, Page 00h,
Byte 200 and is enabled by the host if the host can supply sufficient power to the module.

For QSFP+ modules managed according to SFF-8636, the host system controls whether a particular power class is
enabled using the LPMode input pad and/or by writing to four control bits in SFF-8636, Page 00h, Byte 93. The
management interface specification, SFF-8636 provides complete details but for explanation of power supply
control, the bits are listed in Table 6-4.

3        High Power Class Enable   When set to 1 enables Power Class 8 if listed in Byte 129. When cleared to 0,
         (Class 8)                 modules with Power Class 8 shall dissipate less than the power specified by
                                   bit 2 but are not required to be fully functional. Refer to Table 5-5. Default=0.
2       High_Power_Class_Enable When set to 1 enables Power Classes 5 to 7 if listed in Byte 129. When cleared
        (Classes 5-7)              to 0, modules with Power Classes 5 to 8 shall dissipate less than 3.5 W but
                                   are not required to be fully functional. Default=0.
1       Power_set                  Power set to Low Power Mode (Power Class 1). Default=0.
0       Power_override             Override of LPMode/TxDis pad state to allow power mode setting by software.
Note: Power Class 8 is managed by SFF-8636 rev 3.0 or higher.

For QSFP+ modules, using CMIS, the host may transition paged memory modules to High Power Mode using the
conditions defined by the LowPwrS transition signal (see CMIS Table 6-12) provided that the advertised
MaxPower value is supported in the host system.
 13
If LowPwrS is FALSE when the module is in the ModuleLowPwr state, the module begins to enable High Power 14
Mode operation, using the power up procedures defined for the ModulePwrUp state (see CMIS section 6.3.2.9).
Conversely, whenever LowPwrS or LowPwrExS (as applicable) is TRUE while the module is in or moving towards
High Power Mode, the module begins to return to the ModuleLowPwr state and hence to Low Power Mode 17
operation, using the power down procedures defined for the ModulePwrDn state (see CMIS section 6.3.2.11).

6.6.3 Module Power Supply Specification
Module power supply specifications are given in Table 6-6.

QSFP+ modules operate from the host supplied voltage at the three power pads. To protect the host and system
operation, each QSFP+ module during hot plug and normal operation shall follow the requirements listed in Table
6-6 and illustrated in Figure 6-7.

The test configuration for measuring the supply current is a module power compliance board with reference power
supply filters, similar to the circuit shown in Appendix D and Figure 56 of SFF-8431. The current limits in Table 6-6
refer to the sum of the three currents, e.g. the equivalent of the current through the 0.1 Ω sense resistor in Figure
56 of SFF-8431.

An example current waveform into a host filter, labeled I1 in Figure 6-6 is plotted in Figure 6-7. This figure also
shows the timing of the initial module turn-on in Low Power Mode, and the later transition to full power mode after
the host system has enabled it via the two-wire interface. Timing for a transitional mode, when the module is in
full power mode with the transmitter(s) disabled, is also shown.

In order to avoid exceeding the host system power capacity, upon hot-plug, power cycle or reset, all QSFP modules
shall power up in Low Power Mode if LPMode is asserted. If LPMode is not asserted the module will proceed to

High Power Mode without host intervention. Figure 6-6 shows waveforms for maximum instantaneous, sustained
and steady state currents for Low Power and High Power modes. Specification values for maximum instantaneous,
sustained and steady state currents at each power class are given Table 6-6.

The module shall not be affected by the instantaneous variations of the power supply caused by its own current
drawing profile during all power transient events. The module shall withstand instantaneous power supply Vcc
variations with a slew rate up to 175 mV/ms without traffic hits or errors on the two-wire interface.

Transmitter OFF state inrush current graph is informative. The instantaneous, sustained and steady state currents
shall not exceed the high power mode transmitter ON current max values.

6.6.4 Host Board Power Supply Noise Output
The host shall generate an effective weighted integrated spectrum RMS noise less than the eN_Host value in Table
6-6 when tested by the methods of SFF-8431, section D.17.1 with the following exceptions:
    • The reference filter response H(f) is given by the equation in section D.17.1, reproduced below, using the
       coefficients from Table 6-7 below.
                        H(f) = a×(log10(f))4 +b×log10(f))3 + c×log10(f)2 + d×log10(f) + e
    • The frequency response of the truncated function is illustrated in Figure 6-8. The figure shows the original
       function as specified in SFF-8431 and the scaled function for QSFP+ with inductor value 1 µH.
    • The resistive load for the test needs to be tailored for the QSFP power class and may be implemented using
       constant current sink circuits attached to each host supply filter output. The noise is measured
       independently on each voltage rail with the other voltage rails left open circuit.

6.6.5.1   QSFP+ Module Power Supply Noise Output Test Method based on SFF-8431
The QSFP+ module shall generate less than the Module RMS noise output value in Table 6-6 when tested by the
methods of SFF-8431, section D.17.2. The module noise voltage output is defined in the frequency band 10 Hz to
10 MHz at point X in Figure 6-9. The test fixture source resistor should be scaled by the ratio: (1.5 W / maximum
module power consumption), where maximum module power consumption is either the maximum of the advertised
power class, or the advertised maximum power. The test ensures the module will not couple excessive noise from
inside the module back onto the host board. The module must pass the power supply noise output specification in
all operating modes. A power meter technique, or a spectrum analyzer technique with integration of the spectrum
may be used.

6.6.5.2   QSFP112/QSFP224 Module Power Supply Noise Output Test Method
An alternative method was developed in the QSFP-DD MSA group for QSFP112 and QSFP224. The removal of power
supply filters allows measuring actual noise generated by the module prior to any attenuation by the filter network.

This test method does not use a series resistor as in SFF-8431 and instead uses a current probe with a scope
capable of integrating the current noise from 40 Hz to 10 MHz. Rogowski probes are recommended because they
will minimize added interconnect inductance. Example of such probes are Tektronix TRCP series, Keysight N7042A
or similar. Hall-effect current probes may also be acceptable if added interconnect is negligible, example of such
probes are Tektronix TCP, Keysight N1147B.

The RMS module noise output is defined in a frequency band from 40 Hz to 10 MHz. The module noise output shall
be measured with an appropriate probing technique at point Y, see Figure 6-10. The leads from point Y to Vcc Host
must be kept as short as possible to minimize the impact of added lead inductance. The module must pass the
power supply noise output specification in all operating modes.

6.6.6 Module Power Supply Noise Tolerance
6.6.6.1   QSFP+ Module Power Supply Noise Tolerance Test Method based on SFF-8431
The QSFP+ module shall meet all requirements and remain fully operational in the presence of a sinusoidal tolerance
signal of amplitude given by Table 6-6, swept from 10 Hz to 10 MHz according to the methods of SFF-8431, section
D.17.3. This emulates the worst-case noise output of the host. The source resistance for the power supply and sine
wave generator may need to be reduced from 0.5 Ω to a lower value for high powered modules.

In this test, a swept sinusoidal tone is applied at point X of Figure 6-9. The AC tolerance signal is created by a
circuit such as a low impedance buffer amplifier between the power supply and point X. The impedance of the PSU
and sine wave generator is less than 0.5 Ω. The amplitude of the sine wave is calibrated at each frequency at point
X with the module replaced with a 12 Ω load between Vcc and Vee.

NOTES -- It may be desirable to remove the 0.1 µF capacitors on the host side of the reference filters for this test,
to reduce the power needed by the sine wave generator. The calibration of the sine wave is not expected to be
significantly different if the module were in place rather than the test resistor.

Alternatively, the test may be performed separately for VccT and VccR with the other supply filter connected directly
to the power supply. It is not necessary to show compliance with both separate and common Vcc modulation.
This test applies at minimum and maximum DC setpoint levels. Note that the DC level is inset to the limits in Table
6-6 by the peak of the sinusoidal voltage at the input to the module (which is frequency dependent).
The source frequency is varied over the range specified by Table 6-6 to determine if any frequency causes a
parameter to fall out of the specification limit. In all cases, the parameters measured shall pass the optical standards
with the tone present over all frequencies specified.
6.6.6.2   QSFP112/QSFP224 Module Power Supply Noise Tolerance Test Method
An alternative method was developed in the QSFP-DD MSA group for QSFP112 and QSFP224. It is intended for
easier compliance board setup and implementation.

The removal of power supply filters simplifies the test and reduces the amplitude by as much as 1000x where off
the shelf Power OpAmp can be used. The QSFP112/QSFP224 modules shall meet all requirements and remain fully
operational in the presence of a sinusoidal tolerance signal of amplitude given by Table 6-6.

The reference noise waveform consists of a sinusoidal 40 Hz to 10 MHz noise generated by Osc1, amplified by the
Power OpAmp and added to Vcc PSU through a bias tee, see Figure 6-10. The injected power supply noise is
calibrated at point Y. Example of suitable Power OpAmps are Analog Devices ADA4870, LT1210, TI THS3491. Since
most of these power OpAmps are limited to 1 A peak, the interconnecting impedance of the bias tee must be
greater than 33 mV pk / 1 A pk or 33 mΩ minimum. Based on the minimum suggested frequency of 100 kHz, this
can be resistive (33 mΩ minimum) or reactive (47 nH minimum). The bias tee effective capacitor needs to be
greater than 47 µF, so a stable tantalum capacitor with 30 mΩ ESR is recommended.




                           Figure 6-11 Module High Frequency Noise Tolerance
To facilitate power supply tolerance testing at frequencies < ~100 kHz due to Power OpAmp interaction with PSU
and low frequency response of the Bias-T, it is recommended to use noise source Osc2 modulating PSU sense line
to generate sinusoidal noise directly on the PSU output, see Figure 6-12. Osc2 amplitude level is adjusted while
observing point Y amplitude level as defined in Table 6-6 for module in low power and high-power modes. To
modulate the PSU sense lines, the PSU must have high speed sense tracking. An example of PSU with high-speed
sense tracking are Keysight N6700 Series, Kikusui PBZ series, or supply controllers, such as the TI TPSM5D1806.
The user is responsible for the calibration and the validation of the setup across the whole frequency range. The
user may need to consider alternative proposed solutions if the electrical characteristics of the fixture and setup
requires any component to work beyond its rated operating conditions.

Osc1 and Osc2 are adjusted to produce the value of PSNT_Mod PSNR given in Table 6-6 at point Y with resistive
loads drawing the same power as the module in low and high-power modes. The resistive loads are then replaced
with the module under test with the same Osc1/Osc2 amplitude settings that produced the max PSNR with the
resistive loads.

An appropriate probing technique (such as transmission line probe) is required for noise measurement at point Y.

For modules with limited or no decoupling directly connected to host PSU, the PSNR can be directly measured at
point Y with the module plugged into the host and the module operating in low power and high power modes. Osc1
or Osc2 are adjusted to provide maximum PSNR at point Y for a given module in low power and full power modes.
Depending on the measurement setup, a ground loop isolator may be required to provide common mode rejection
as described in Technical Reference 2 in Section 2.2 .

6.6.6.3    Module Power Supply Noise Tolerance Test Method using Commercial Injector Probe
Module power supply noise tolerance implementation of section 6.6.6.2 can be replaced with commercially produced
injector probes, an example of such injector probe is Picotest P2124A. Injector probe combines a power rail voltage
(input voltage) with a modulation signal and injects the noisy bus voltage into the module being tested for noise
immunity (PSNR). The form factor of injector probe is such that it can be positioned at the card edge, eliminating
power cables and the inductance that can limit the modulation amplitude and bandwidth. This modulation scheme
supports the full range from 40 Hz-10 MHz without having to change setups at ~100 kHz.

The probe-based implementation supports the requirements by getting close enough to the module under test to
allow the 10 MHz modulation with little attenuation. The DC input power supply voltage at the host can be held
constant using a supplied remote sense filter. The remote sense filter allows the user to switch between different
operating modes (high power, low power etc.) while keeping the operating point stable across every power state
transition. With the appropriate PSU unit and remote filtering, the injector probe will compensate for any additional
voltage drop due to the modulator and the interconnects.

 Note 2: Power on is defined as the instant when supply voltages reach and remain at or above the minimum level specified in
            Table 5-6.
 Note 3: Fully functional is defined as the module being ready to transmit and receive valid signals and all management interface
            data, including monitors, being valid. It is indicated after Reset or hot plug by the module releasing IntL to high after
            the host has read a 0 from the Data_Not_Ready flag bit.
 Note 4: Measured from rising edge of SDA during STOP sequence of read transaction.
 Note 5: Does not apply to Power Class 1 modules.
 Note 6: For some modules this limit is overridden via the management interface, SFF-8636, CMIS or by custom product
            specifications.
 Note 7: For Fibre Channel speed negotiation, the 100 ms limit is too slow. See the relevant standard for details of the timing
            requirements.
