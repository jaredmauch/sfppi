     1 Scope
This specification defines a common memory map and protocol that can be used to manage both 4-channel
pluggable transceiver modules and 4-channel managed external cable interface implementations. Physical layer
and mechanical details of the interface are outside the scope of this document. Memory map details and
communication protocol used to transfer the information are described within this document. This approach
facilitates a common memory map and management interface for modules or cable assemblies with different
mechanical, physical layer, and other characteristics. Examples include the QSFP+ family and mini multilane
connectors for SAS (see REF-TA-1011).


This specification does not apply to the CFP MSA family of modules, which use the MDIO interface and a different
memory map.

NUMBERING CONVENTIONS
The ISO convention of numbering is used (i.e., the thousands and higher multiples are separated by a space and
a period is used as the decimal point). This is equivalent to the English/American convention of a comma and a
period.

NUMERALS CONSTANTS
Numerals without suffix are understood as numbers in decimal notation (e.g. 16). Hexadecimal literals are marked
with a suffix ‘h’ (e.g. 10h), often written with leading zeroes (0010h). Binary literals are marked with a suffix ‘b’
(e.g. 10000b), often written with leading zeroes (00010000b). The suffixes may be omitted for unambiguous cases
like 0=0b=0h and 1=1b=1h. Spaces may be inserted to make long hexadecimal or binary digit strings readable
(e.g. 0001 0000b).

3.1 Keywords
May/ may not: Indicates flexibility of choice with no implied preference.

Obsolete: Indicates that an item was defined in prior specifications but has been removed from this specification.

Optional: Describes features which are not required by the SFF specification. However, if any feature defined by
the SFF specification is implemented, it shall be done in the same way as defined by the specification. Describing
a feature as optional in the text is done to assist the reader.

Reserved: Defines the signal on a connector contact [when] its actual function is set aside for future
standardization. It is not available for vendor-specific use. Where this term is used for bits, bytes, fields, and values;
the bits, bytes, fields, and values are set aside for future standardization. The default value shall be zero. The
originator is required to define a Reserved field or bit as zero, but the receiver should not check Reserved fields or
bits for zero.

Shall: Indicates a mandatory requirement. Designers are required to implement all such mandatory requirements
to ensure interoperability with other products that conform to this specification.

Should: Indicates flexibility of choice with a strongly preferred alternative.

Vendor specific: Indicates something (e.g., a bit, field, code value) that is not defined by this specification.
Specification of the referenced item is determined by the manufacturer and may be used differently in various
implementations.

Fixed
The terminology "fixed" is used to describe the gender of the mating side of the connector that accepts its mate
upon mating. This gender is frequently, but not always, associated with the common terminology "receptacle".
Other terms commonly used are "female" and "socket connector". The term "fixed" is adopted from EIA standard
terminology as the gender that most commonly exists on the fixed end of a connection, for example, on the board
or bulkhead side. In this document, the terms “fixed”, “fixed-side”, and “host” are equivalent.

Free
The terminology "free" is used to describe the gender of the mating side of the connector that penetrates its mate
upon mating. This gender is frequently, but not always, associated with the common terminology "plug". Other
terms commonly used are "male" and "pin connector". The term "free" is adopted from EIA standard terminology
as the gender that most commonly exists on the free end of a connection, for example, on the cable side. In this
document, the terms “free”, “free-side”, and “module” are equivalent.

Passive Cable
In this specification, a passive cable requires power only to operate the management interface circuitry.

Active Cable
In this specification, an active cable requires power for circuitry that is used to transmit and receive high-speed
signals. In addition, power is required to operate the management interface. The high-speed electrical interface
of the cable may contain equalizers and retimers (CDRs) which are managed by registers defined in this
management interface specification.

Pluggable Transceiver Module
In this specification, a pluggable transceiver module, also known as a separable module (SM), requires power for
the management interface and for the circuitry integral to the Tx/Rx high-speed serial channels supported by the
module. The module also has a media dependent interface (MDI), such as a duplex single mode fiber or a parallel
multimode fiber connector. The high-speed electrical interface of the module may contain equalizers and retimers
(CDRs) which are managed by registers defined in this management interface specification. In this document, the
terms “free”, “free-side”, and “module” are equivalent.

     4 General Description
The management interface provides a method for the fixed side to determine the characteristics and status of the
free side through a memory map. In some implementations, the interface also provides a mechanism to control
the operation of the free side circuitry. For the case where the module is an end of a cable assembly, the host can
determine if the cable assembly is passive, active copper, or active optical. For the case where the module is a
transceiver, the host can determine if the module is used with single-mode or multimode fiber, or a copper cable
assembly, and which industry standards are supported. Parameters such as supplier, part number, propagation
delay and loss (for passive cable assemblies) can also be determined.

4.4 Reset Behavior
4.4.1 Protocol Reset
Synchronization issues may cause the controller and target state machines to disagree on the specific bit location
currently being transferred. See 5.2.2.


4.4.2 Power On Reset
When power is applied, the module will set all registers to their default values and reset the 2-wire interface. The
timing is specified in the relevant hardware specification.


4.4.3 Reset Signals
Some implementations may include a reset pin (ResetL) and/or the optional software reset bit (see Page 00h Byte
93 bit 7). If provided, upon assertion of either signal the module will set all registers to their default values and
reset the 2-wire interface. The timing is specified in the relevant hardware specification.


     5 2-wire Bus Interface
5.1 Signal Interface
The 2-wire interface shall consist of a controller and a target. The fixed side shall be the controller and the free
side shall be the target. Control and data are transferred serially. The controller shall initiate all data transfers. Data
can be transferred from the controller to the target and from the target to the controller. The 2-wire interface shall
consist of the clock (SCL) and data (SDA) signals.

The controller utilizes SCL to clock data and control information on the 2-wire bus. The controller and target shall
latch the state of SDA on the positive transitioning edge of SCL.

The SDA signal is bi-directional. During data transfer, the SDA signal shall transition when SCL is low. A transition
on the SDA signal, while SCL is high, shall indicate a stop or start condition.
5.2 2-wire Bus Protocol
5.2.1 The operational States and State Transitions
5.2.1.1 Start
A high-to-low transition of SDA with SCL high is a START condition. All 2-wire bus operations shall begin with a
START condition.
5.2.1.2 Stop
A low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL high is a STOP condition. All 2-wire bus operations shall end with a STOP
condition
5.2.1.3 Acknowledge
After sending each 8-bit word, the side driving the 2-wire bus releases the SDA line for one-bit time, during which
the monitoring side of the 2-wire bus is allowed to pull SDA low (zero) to acknowledge (ACK) that it has received
each word. Write data operations shall be acknowledged by the target for all bytes. Read data operations shall be
acknowledged by the controller for all but the final byte read, for which the controller shall respond with a non-
acknowledge (NACK) by permitting SDA to remain high and followed by a STOP.
5.2.1.4 Clock Stretching
To extend the transfer the target asserts clock low. This can be used by the target to delay completion of the
operation.

5.2.2 Protocol Reset
Synchronization issues may cause the controller and target state machines to disagree on the specific bit location
currently being transferred, the type of operation or even if an operation is in progress. The 2-wire interface protocol
has no explicitly defined reset mechanism. The following procedure may force completion of the current operation
and cause the target to release SDA.

    a)   The controller shall provide up to nine SCL clock cycles (drive low, then high) to the target.
    b)   The controller shall monitor SDA while SCL is high on each cycle.
    c)   If the target releases SDA, it will be high and the controller shall initiate a START condition.
    d)   If SDA remains low after a full nine clock cycles the protocol reset has failed.


5.2.3 Format
5.2.3.1 Control
After the start condition, the first 8-bit word of a 2-wire bus operation shall consist of the 7-bit target address
'1010000' followed by a read/write control bit.


             1            0             1            0             0            0            0           R/W
            MSB                                                                                          LSB

The least significant bit indicates if the operation is a data read or write. A read operation is performed if this bit is
high and a write operation is executed if this bit is set low. Upon completion of the control word transmission, the
target shall assert the SDA signal low to acknowledge delivery (ACK) of the control/address word.
5.2.3.2 Address and Data
Following the read/write control bit, and acknowledgment by the target, addresses and data words are transmitted
in 8-bit words with the most significant bit (MSB) first.


5.3 Read/Write Operations
5.3.1 Target Memory Address Counter (Read and Write Operations)
All 2-wire targets maintain an internal data word address counter containing the address accessed by the latest
read or write operation, incremented by one. The address counter is incremented whenever a data word is received
or sent by the target. This address remains valid between operations as long as the power to the target is
maintained. Upon loss of power to or reset of the free side device, the target address counter contents may be
indeterminate. The address rolls over from the last byte of the 128-byte memory page to the first byte of the same
page.
5.3.2 Write Operations (BYTE Write)
For a write operation the controller sends the target write control byte (10100000), monitors acknowledgment and
then sends an 8-bit data word address. Upon receipt of the address, the target responds with a zero (ACK) to
acknowledge and then clocks in the first 8-bit data word. Following the receipt of the 8-bit data word, the target
shall output a zero (ACK) and the controller must terminate the write sequence with a STOP condition for the write
cycle to begin. If a START condition is sent in place of a STOP condition (i.e. a repeated START per the 2-wire
interface specification) the write is aborted and the data received during that operation is discarded. Upon receipt
of the proper STOP condition, the target enters an internally timed write cycle, tWR, to internal memory. The target
disables its management interface input during this write cycle and shall not respond or acknowledge subsequent
commands until the internal memory write is complete.

Note that 2-wire interface 'Combined Format' using repeated START conditions is not supported on write
commands.

5.3.3 Write Operations (Sequential Write)
The 2-wire target shall support a write of up to four sequential bytes without repeated target address and memory
address information. A sequential write is initiated the same way as a single byte write, but the host controller does
not send a stop condition after the first word is clocked in. Instead, after the target acknowledges receipt of the
first data word, the controller can transmit up to three more data words. The target shall send an acknowledge
after each data word received. The controller must terminate the sequential write sequence with a STOP condition
or the write operation shall be aborted and data discarded. Note that 2-wire interface 'combined format' using
repeated START conditions is not supported on write commands.

5.3.4 Write Operations (Acknowledge Polling)
Once the target internally timed write cycle has begun (and inputs are being ignored on the bus) acknowledge
polling can be used to determine when the write operation is complete. This involves sending a START condition
followed by the device address word. When the internal write cycle is complete the target shall respond to
subsequent commands with an acknowledge indicating that read or write operations may continue.

5.3.6 Read Operations (Random Read)
A random read operation requires a dummy write operation to load in the target byte address. This is accomplished
by the following sequence: The target 8-bit data word address is sent following the device address write word
(10100000) and acknowledged by the target. The controller then generates another START condition (aborting the
dummy write without incrementing the counter) and a current address read by sending a device read address
(10100001). The target acknowledges the device address and serially clocks out the requested data word. The
transfer is terminated when the controller responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge.

Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. To specify a sequential
read, the controller responds with an acknowledge (instead of a STOP) after each data word. As long as the target
receives an acknowledge, it shall serially clock out sequential data words. The transfer is terminated when the
controller responds with a NACK and a STOP instead of an acknowledge.

     6 Memory Map
6.1 Overview
The memory map is utilized for status, ID, monitoring and control functions.

The map is arranged into a single lower page address space of 128 bytes and multiple upper address pages of 128
bytes each. This structure permits timely access to information in the lower page such as interrupt flags and
monitors. Less time-critical entries such as serial ID information and threshold settings are available with the page
select function.

Lower Page 00h is required and includes interrupt flags and monitor results arranged to enable single block read
operations for time-critical data.

Upper Page 00h is required and provides static module identity and capabilities information.

Page 01h is optional, was used to support SFF-8079, is deprecated as of SFF-8636 Rev 2.10 and is now reserved
memory. Implementation of Page 01h is advertised in Page 00h, Byte 195, bit 6.

Page 02h is optional and provides a user read/write space. Implementation of Page 02h is advertised in Page 00h,
Byte 195, bit 7.

Page 03h is optional and includes static monitor thresholds, advertising, and various channel controls including
interrupt masks. Implementation of Page 03h is advertised in Page 00h, Byte 2, bit 2.

Pages 20h-21h contain support for additional monitored parameters for modules that have PAM4 modulation and/or
have optical transmission at multiple wavelengths on a DWDM grid. Page 20h provides the alarms, warnings, masks,
parameter values, and configuration. Page 21h provides the alarm and warning thresholds. Implementation of
Pages 20h and 21h is advertised in Page 00, Byte 195, bit 0.

Pages 22-7Fh are reserved for future use. Pages 04-1Fh and 80-FFh are for vendor-specific functions.

Writing the value of a non-supported page shall not be accepted by the target. The Page Select byte shall revert
to 0h and read/write operations shall be to Upper Page 00h. Because Upper Page 00h is read-only, this scheme
prevents the inadvertent corruption of module memory by a host attempting to write to a non-supported location.

6.1.1 Required Versus Optional Functionality
The memory map tables contained within this section include columns for passive cables (PC), active cables (AC),
active optical cables (AO) and separable modules (SM). Depending on the free side device type, some common
memory map parameters are optional. In each column, one of three options is specified: required (R), optional (O)
or conditional upon another parameter which is optional (C). Entries with a dash (-) indicate that whether the byte
or bit is required is not relevant.

Lower Page 00h is used to access a variety of measurement, diagnostic and control functions. In addition, a
mechanism to select upper memory map pages is provided. This portion of the address space is always directly
addressable and thus is chosen for monitoring and control functions that may need to be repeatedly accessed.

6.2.3 Interrupt Flags (Page 00h, Bytes 3-21)
Bytes 3-21 consist of interrupt flags for LOS, Tx Fault, warnings and alarms. The non-asserted state shall be 0b. If
an interrupt flag condition is true, the free side shall assert the corresponding flag bit to 1b. The flag bit shall remain
set until the fixed-side performs a read operation of the bit or the free side is reset. Flag bits cleared while underlying
interrupt condition remains true may be immediately set again by the free side device. During this process, the IntL
output signal may be re-asserted if the associated mask bit is not set. These flags may be masked.

6.2.4 Free Side Device Monitors (Page 00h, Bytes 22-33)
Real-time monitoring for the free side device includes internal temperature and supply voltage. In addition there
are optional monitors for the optical lanes of separable modules.

The fixed side shall use 2-byte reads to retrieve the 16-bit measurements to guarantee data coherency. The free
side device shall prevent the host from acquiring partially updated multi-byte data during a 2-byte read. Clock
stretching provides one mechanism to delay the delivery of data until both bytes of a field are updated. The data
format may facilitate greater resolution and range than required. Reference of the specific product specification of
the free side device or interoperability standard is necessary to determine the measurement accuracy.

Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage and should be interpreted
as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values should be interpreted in the same manner as real-time 16-
bit data.

Internally measured free side device temperatures are represented as a 16-bit signed twos complement value in
increments of 1/256 degrees Celsius, yielding a total range of -128 ºC to +127 ºC that is considered valid between
-40 ºC and +125 ºC. Temperature accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than +/-3 ºC over the specified
operating temperature and voltage. Placement of the temperature sensor is vendor specific.

Internally measured free side device supply voltages are represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the voltage
defined as the full 16-bit value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 100 µV, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to
+6.55 V. Practical considerations to be defined by free side device manufacturer will tend to limit the actual bounds
of the supply voltage measurement. Accuracy is Vendor Specific but must be better than +/-3% of the
manufacturer's nominal value over specified operating temperature and voltage.


6.2.5 Channel Monitors (Page 00h, Bytes 34-81)
Real-time channel monitoring for each transmit and receive channel includes optical input power and Tx bias
current.

Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage and should be interpreted
as defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values should be interpreted in the same manner as real-time 16-
bit data.

Measured Tx bias current is represented in mA as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the current defined as the full 16-
bit value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 2 µA, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to 131 mA. Accuracy is
Vendor Specific but must be better than +/-10% of the manufacturer's nominal value over specified operating
temperature and voltage.

Measured Rx received optical power is represented in mW as either an average received power or OMA depending
upon how Page 00h Byte 220 bit 3 is set. The parameter is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the power
defined as the full 16-bit value (0 to 65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 µW, yielding a total measurement range of 0 to
6.5535 mW (~-40 to +8.2 dBm). Absolute accuracy is dependent upon the exact optical wavelength. For the vendor
specified wavelength, accuracy shall be better than +/-3 dB over specified temperature and voltage. This accuracy
shall be maintained for input power levels up to the lesser of maximum transmitted or maximum received optical
power per the appropriate standard. It shall be maintained down to the minimum transmitted power minus cable
plant loss (insertion loss or passive loss) per the appropriate standard. Absolute accuracy beyond this minimum
required received input optical power range is vendor specific.

Measured Tx optical power is the average power represented in mW. The parameter is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned

For transceivers with CDR capability, setting the CDR to ON engages the internal retiming function. Setting the CDR
to OFF enables an internal bypassing mode, which directs traffic around the internal CDR. The two most common
reasons to turn a CDR off (i.e. internally bypass it) are to run at rates not supported by a particular CDR or to save
the thermal power in applications where CDR jitter mitigation is not required. Jitter specifications of the high-speed
interfaces are outside the scope of this specification.

QSFP+ and QSFP28 modules have the LPMode input signal (see SFF-8679) that can be used by the host system to
force the module into Low Power Mode. Low Power Mode for those modules is defined as maximum power
consumption of 1.5W. If the LPMode input signal is pulled low by the host system, the module is then capable of
entering High Power Mode. The maximum power consumption in High Power Mode depends on the module Power
Class as advertised in the Extended Identifier (see 6.3.2), Page 00h, byte 129, bits 1-0 and 7-6.

The operation of the LPMode input signal can be overridden by the host writing a ‘1’ to byte 93, bit 0. In that case,
the function of the LPMode input signal is replaced by byte 93, bit 1.

SFF-8436 has 4 power classes from 1.5 to 3.5 W. Only bits 7-6 are used to define those power classes. At revision
1.9 of this specification, 3 new higher power classes, 4.0 W, 4.5 W, and 5.0 W were added. These power classes,
designated power classes 5, 6 and 7, are designated using bits 1-0 of the Extended Identifier byte, page 00h byte
129. In order to protect legacy host systems designed to support only the original 4 power classes, the High Power
Class Enable control was defined at byte 93, bit 2. Modules in power classes 5, 6, 7 or 8 are required to limit power
consumption to no more than a power class 4 module if the High Power Class Enable, byte 93 bit 2 control is not
set. They are not required to be functional in this situation.

Starting with SFF-8636 Rev 2.10, a new Power Class 8 is introduced. It is enabled using byte 93, bit 3 and is
advertised using upper page 00h, byte 129, bit 5. Power Class 8 modules use byte 107 to advertise the maximum
power consumption of the module. For Power Class 8 advertising see page 00h, byte 129. Modules in power class
8 are required to limit power consumption to no more than a power class 7 module if the High Power Class Enable,
byte 93 bit 3 control is not set. They are not required to be functional in this situation.

A truth table for the power controls in byte 93 bits 0, 1, 2 and 3, is shown in Table 6-11.

Power class limits and controls for microQSFP modules are different from the description here. Refer to the MSA
specification for details.

        (*) LPMode is a signal carried on a dual-purpose contact. When the dual-purpose contact is not
        programmed as LPMode, the module behaves as though LPMode = 0. Refer to SFF-8679 section 5.3.3 for
        details.
6.2.7 Rate Select
Rate Select is an optional control used to limit the receiver bandwidth for compatibility with multiple signaling rates.
In addition, rate selection allows the transmitter and receiver to be tuned for specific rates. For more information,
see Appendix A.

The free side device shall implement one of two options:

a)      Provide no support for rate selection
b)      Rate selection using extended rate select


6.2.7.1 No Rate Selection Support
When no rate selection is supported, (Page 00h Byte 221 bits 2 and 3) have a value of 0 and Options (Page 00h
Byte 195 bit 5) has a value of 0. Lack of implementation does not indicate a lack of simultaneous compliance with
multiple standard rates. See 6.3.4 for the description of how compliance with particular standards should be
determined.

6.2.7.2 Extended Rate Selection
When Page 00h Byte 195 bit 5 is 1 and Rate Select declaration bits (Page 00h Byte 221 bits 2 and 3) have the
values of 0 and 1 respectively and at least one of the bits in the Extended Rate Compliance byte (Page 00h Byte
141) has a value of one, the free side device supports extended rate select. For extended rate selection, two bits
are assigned to each receiver in Byte 87 (Rxn_Rate_Select) and two bits for each transmitter in Byte 88
(Txn_Rate_Select) to specify up to four rates. See Table 6-12 for the functionality when Byte 141 bits 0-1 are set.
All other values of the Extended Rate Compliance byte are reserved.

6.2.8 Free Side Device Indicators and Channel Masks (Page 00h, Bytes 100-106)
The fixed side may control which flags result in a hardware interrupt by setting high individual bits from a set of
masking bits in Page 00h Bytes 100-104 for free side device flags, and Page 03h Bytes 242-251 for channel flags.
See Table 6-13 and Table 6-35. A 1 value in a masking bit prevents the assertion of the hardware interrupt pin, if
one exists, by the corresponding latched flag bit. Masking bits are volatile and startup with all unmasked (masking
bits 0).

The mask bits may be used to prevent continued interruption from on-going conditions, which would otherwise
continually reassert the hardware interrupt pin. A mask bit is allocated for each flag bit.

6.2.9 Free Side Device Properties (Page 00h, Bytes 107-117)
Byte 107 indicates the maximum module power consumption in 0.1 W increments. This field shall be populated if
the module advertises Power Class 8 in Page 00h Byte 129 (see Table 6-16). However, non-Power Class 8 modules
may also report their maximum module power consumption in this field. Modules that do not report their maximum
power consumption shall populate this field with 00h.

The unsigned 16-bit value in Bytes 108-109 indicates the propagation delay of the non-separable free side device.
Byte 108 bit 7 is the most significant bit and Byte 109 bit 0 is the least significant. Each unit of the combined value
corresponds to 10 ns with fractional values rounded up to the next unit.

Byte 110 bits 7-4 specify the free-side device power consumption levels below 1.5 W. A value of 0000 shall indicate
that a power consumption limit below 1.5 W is not available. A value of 0001 shall indicate the free-side device
shall consume no more than 1 W, 0010 indicates no more than 0.75 W and 0011 indicates no more than 0.5 W.

A value of 1 in Byte 110 bit 3 shall indicate that both ends of the free-side device comply with the SFF-8636
specification. A value of 0 shall be utilized for all other cases including the use of other management interfaces
specifications and separable applications where the free-side device ends and media can be physically separated
from each other. Byte 110 bits 2-0 indicate that the free-side device can operate properly from less than nominal
3.3 V on the Vcc pins. A value of 000 indicates the feature is disabled. The free-side device shall operate properly
from nominal 2.5 V with a value of 001 and nominal 1.8 V with a value of 010.

The use of Bytes 111-112 is not defined in this specification.

Byte 113 bits 3-0 specify which channels of the free side device at the near end are implemented. A value of 0
indicates that the channel is implemented and a value of 1 indicates that the channel is not implemented.

Byte 113 bits 6-4 are used to indicate what type of device(s) are implemented at the far end(s) of a cable or
module. A separable free side device or a device that does not specify the far end implementation is coded 000.

The ModSelL wait time fields define the minimum supported setup time for the ModSelL signal, defined as the
elapsed time between host assertion of ModSelL and the start of a two-wire serial bus transaction and the required
delay from completion of a two-wire serial bus transaction until the host can de-assert the ModSelL signal. For
example, if the module wait time is 1.6 ms, the mantissa field (bits 4-0) will be 11001b and the exponent field (bits
7-5) will be 110b indicating six binary zeroes after the 11001b, for a net result of 11001000000b, or 1600 decimal.

Host implementers should note that the host must use the worst-case ModSelL wait time for all modules on the
same shared two-wire serial bus. For example, when a new module is hot swapped onto the shared serial bus, the
host must use the wait time specified in the hardware specification for all modules on that serial bus, until the
supported ModSelL wait time for that new module can be identified.

The secondary extended specification compliance code in Byte 116 identifies an electrical or optical interface that
is not included in Table 6-17 Specification Compliance Codes, and is an additional supported specification relative
to Page 00h, Byte 192 (see 6.3.23).

An additional sub-type identifier in Byte 117 bits 7-4 can be used to provide information to the host on mechanical
and thermal implementation. Refer to SFF-8024 for possible values and the hardware specification for more
information on the listed sub-types. When applicable, the Fiber Face Type, byte 117, bits 1-0 are used to identify
the fiber face type for the specific connector type. The values are listed in SFF-8024.

6.2.10 Password Entry and Change (Page 00h, Bytes 119-126)
Bytes 119-126 are reserved for an optional password entry function. The Password entry bytes are write-only and
will be retained until power down, reset, or rewritten by fixed side. This function may be used to control read/write
access to Vendor Specific Page 02h. Additionally, free side device vendors may use this function to implement write
protection of Serial ID and other read-only information. Passwords may be supplied to and used by fixed side
system manufacturers to limit write access in the User EEPROM Page 02h.

Password access shall not be required to access free side device data in the lower memory Page 00h or in Upper
Page 00h, 02h, and 03h. Note that multiple manufacturer passwords may be defined to allow selective access to
read or write to various sections of memory as allowed above.

Fixed side manufacturer and free side device manufacturer passwords shall be distinguished by the high order bit
(bit 7, Byte 123). All fixed side manufacturer passwords shall fall in the range of 00000000h to 7FFFFFFFh and all
free side device manufacturer passwords in the range of 80000000h to FFFFFFFFh. Fixed side system manufacturer
passwords shall be initially set to 00001011h in new free side devices.

Fixed side system manufacturer passwords may be changed by writing a new password in Bytes 119-122 when the
correct current fixed side manufacture password has been entered in 123-126, with the high order bit being ignored
and forced to a value of 0 in the new password. The password entry field shall be set to 00000000h on power-up
and reset.
6.2.11 Page Select (Page 00h, Byte 127)
Byte 127 is used to select the upper page. A value of 00h indicates upper memory Page 00h is mapped to Bytes
128-255 and a value of 01h indicates that upper Page 01h if available is mapped to Bytes 128-255. Similarly, values
of 02h, 03h, 20h, and 21h indicate which upper page is mapped to Bytes 128-255. If the host attempts to write a
page select value which is not supported in a particular module, the Page Select byte will revert to 00h.

6.3.1 Identifier (00h 128)
The Identifier Values at Byte 128 specify the physical device described by the serial information. This value shall
be included in the serial data. These values are maintained in the Transceiver Management section of SFF-8024.


6.3.2 Extended Identifier (00h 129)
The extended identifier provides additional information about the free side device. For example, the identifier
indicates if the free side device contains a CDR function and identifies the power consumption class it belongs to.

Power classes 5, 6 and 7 were added in rev 1.9 of this specification to enable modules requiring more than 3.5W
of consumption. However, legacy systems were designed for a maximum of 3.5W. To ensure that those systems
were not harmed by power classes 5, 6 or 7 a lockout feature was added in Byte 93 bit 2 to enable high power
mode for those modules. A legacy system does not know about Byte 129 bits 1-0 or about Byte 93 bit 2. New
systems know about both and can configure power class 5 through 7 support accordingly. The power class
identifiers specify maximum power consumption over operating conditions and life with all supported settings set
to worst case values.

Power Class 8 is introduced by rev 2.10 of this specification. Class 8 modules advertise a fine-grained value of
power consumption in Page 00h, Byte 107. See SFF-8679 for QSFP+/QSFP28 power consumption values. If byte
129, bit 5 is set a module may also indicate one of the other power classes using bits 7-6 and 1-0, if it complies
with that class. It should set bits 7-6 and 1-0 to all 1’s if the maximum power consumption is greater than or
equal to Power Class 7.

The Connector Type entry at Page 00H Byte 130 indicates the connector type for the separable portion of the free
side device (see 4.3.2). This value shall be included in the serial data. These values are maintained in the
Transceiver Management section of SFF-8024.

6.3.5 Encoding (00h 139)
The Encoding Values at Page 00h Byte 139 indicate the serial encoding mechanism for the high-speed serial
interface. The value shall be contained in the serial data. These values are maintained in the Transceiver
Management section of SFF-8024.
6.3.6 Nominal Signaling Rate (00h 140)
The nominal signaling rate per channel (BR, nominal) is specified in units of 100 Megabaud in byte 140 and in units
of 250 Megabaud in byte 222. The baud rate includes overhead necessary to encode and delimit the signal as well
as symbols carrying data information. A value of 0 indicates the baud rate is not specified and must be determined
from the module technology. A value of FFh in byte 140 means the baud rate exceeds 25.4 GBd and byte 222 must
be used to determine nominal baud rate. The actual information transfer rate will depend on the encoding of the
data, as defined by the encoding value (byte 139).
6.3.7 Extended Rate Select Compliance (00h 141)
The Extended Rate Select Compliance field is used to allow a single free side device the flexibility to comply with
single or multiple Extended Rate Select definitions. A definition is indicated by the presence of a '1' in the specified
bit. If exclusive, non-overlapping definitions are used, Page 00h Byte 141 will allow compliance to 8 distinct multi-
rate definitions.

that the free side device does not support single mode fiber or that the length information must be determined
from the free side device technology. For all cable assemblies, including active optical cables, the value shall be
zero.
6.3.9 Length (OM3) (00h 143)
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free side device while operating in
compliance with the applicable standards using 2000 MHz*km (850 nm) extended bandwidth 50-micron multi-mode
fiber. The value is in units of 2 meters. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support OM3 fiber
or that the length information must be determined from the free side device technology. For all cable assemblies,
including active optical cables, the value shall be zero.


6.3.10 Length (OM2) (00h 144)
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free side device while operating in
compliance with the applicable standards using 500 MHz*km (850 nm and 1310 nm) 50-micron multi-mode fiber.
The value is in units of 1 meter. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support OM2 fiber or that
the length information must be determined from the free side device technology. For all cable assemblies, including
active optical cables, the value shall be zero.
6.3.11 Length (OM1) or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 145)
This value specifies the link length that is supported by a separable module free side device while operating in
compliance with the applicable standards using 200 MHz*km (850 nm) and 500 MHz*km (1310 nm) 62.5-micron
multi-mode fiber. The value is in units of 1 meter. A value of zero means that the free side device does not support
OM1 fiber or that the length information must be determined from the free side device technology.

For copper cable assemblies, where page 00h byte 147 bits 7-4 are 1010b, 1011b, 1101b or 1111b, this register is
used to record the cable attenuation (or apparent attenuation from the near end of the cable for active cables) at
25.78 GHz in units of 1 dB. An indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the case where the attenuation is not known
or is unavailable. For active optical cables or copper cables not listed in this paragraph, the value shall be zero.


6.3.12 Length: Cable Assembly or Optical Fiber (OM4) (00h 146)
If a separable module (as indicated by a value other than 23h in Byte 130) free side device transmitter technology
is 850nm VCSEL (indicated by Byte 147 bits 7-4) then this value specifies the link length supported while operating
in compliance with the applicable standards using 4700 MHz*km (850nm) extended bandwidth 50-micron multi-
mode fiber (OM4). The value is in units of 2 meters.

Otherwise, this value specifies the link length of a Cable assembly (copper or AOC) in units of 1 meter. Link length
is as specified in the INF-8074. Link lengths less than 1 meter shall indicate 1 meter.

A value of zero means the free side device is not a cable assembly or the length information must be determined
from the separable free side device technology. A value of 255 means a separable module VCSEL free side device
supports a link length greater than 508 meters or the cable assembly has a link length greater than 254 meters.
6.3.13 Device Technology (00h 147)
Aspects of the device or cable technology used are described by the Device Technology byte. An active optical
cable may be distinguished from a separable module by reading Byte 130 (Connector Type).

6.3.16 Vendor Organizationally Unique Identifier Field (00h 165-167)
The vendor organizationally unique identifier field (vendor OUI) is a 3-byte field that contains the IEEE Company
Identifier for the vendor. A value of all zero in the 3-byte field indicates that the Vendor OUI is unspecified.
6.3.17 Vendor Part Number (00h 168-183)
The vendor part number (vendor PN) is a 16-byte field that contains ASCII characters, left-aligned and padded on
the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining the vendor part number or product name. A value of all zero in the 16-
byte field indicates that the vendor PN is unspecified.
6.3.18 Vendor Revision Number (00h 184-185)
The vendor revision number (vendor rev) is a 2-byte field that contains ASCII characters, left-aligned and padded
on the right with ASCII spaces (20h), defining the vendor's product revision number. A value of all zero in the field
indicates that the vendor Rev is unspecified.
6.3.19 Wavelength or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 186-187)
For optical free side devices, this parameter identifies the nominal transmitter output wavelength at room
temperature. This parameter is a 16-bit hex value with Byte 186 as high order byte and Byte 187 as low order byte.
The laser wavelength is equal to the 16-bit integer value divided by 20 in nm (units of 0.05 nm). This resolution
should be adequate to cover all relevant wavelengths yet provide enough resolution for all expected DWDM
applications. For an accurate representation of controlled wavelength applications, this value should represent the
center of the guaranteed wavelength range.

If the free side device is identified as copper cable these registers are used to define the cable attenuation. An
indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the case where the attenuation is not known or is unavailable.

Byte 186 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 2.5 GHz in units of 1 dB.

Byte 187 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 5.0 GHz in units of 1 dB.
6.3.20 Wavelength Tolerance or Copper Cable Attenuation (00h 188-189)
The guaranteed tolerance of transmitter output wavelength under all normal operating conditions. For copper cable
assemblies, the value is zero. This parameter is a 16-bit value with Byte 188 as high order byte and Byte 189 as
low order byte. The laser wavelength is equal to the 16-bit integer value divided by 200 in nm (units of 0.005 nm).
Thus, the following two examples:

Example 1:

10GBASE-LR Wavelength Range = 1260 to 1355 nm
Nominal Wavelength in Bytes 186-187 = 1307.5 nm.
Represented as INT(1307.5 nm * 20) = 26150 = 6626h
Wavelength Tolerance in Bytes 188-189 = 47.5 nm.
Represented as INT(47.5 nm * 200) = 9500 = 251Ch

Example 2:

ITU-T Grid Wavelength = 1534.25 nm (195.4 THz) with 0.236 nm (30 GHz) Tolerance
Nominal Wavelength in Bytes 186-187 = 1534.25 nm.
Represented as INT(1534.25 nm * 20) = 30685 = 77DDh
Wavelength Tolerance in Bytes 188-189 = 0.236 nm.
Represented as INT(0.236 nm * 200) = 47 = 002Fh

If the free side device is identified as copper cable these registers are used to define the cable attenuation. An
indication of 0 dB attenuation refers to the case where the attenuation is not known or is unavailable.

Byte 188 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 7.0 GHz in units of 1 dB.

Byte 189 (00-FFh) is the copper cable attenuation at 12.9 GHz in units of 1 dB.
6.3.21 Maximum Case Temperature (00h 190)
This parameter allows specification of a maximum case temperature other than the standard 70C. Maximum case
temperature is an 8-bit value in degrees C. A value of 00h indicates 70C.
6.3.22 CC_BASE (00h 191)
The check code is a 1-byte code that can be used to verify that the first 63 bytes of serial information in the free
side device are valid. The check code shall be the low order 8 bits of the sum of the contents of all the bytes from
128 to 190, inclusive.
6.3.23 Extended Specification Compliance Codes (00h 192)
The Extended Specification Compliance Codes in Byte 192 identify the electronic or optical interfaces which are not
included in Table 6-17 Specification Compliance Codes. These values are maintained in the Transceiver
Management section of SFF-8024
6.3.24 Options (00h 193-195)
The bits in the options field shall specify the options implemented in the free side device.

Variable transceiver Tx input EQ and Rx output emphasis have been added, defined as the EQ and Emphasis
capability designed into the transceiver in support of TP1a and TP4, respectively as defined in IEE802.3 Clause 86.
Transceiver support of programmable EQ and Emphasis is found in Byte 193 bits 1 to 3 and shown below in Table
6-22. The default host control mechanism is "Fixed Position Programmable", found in Page 03h, Bytes 234-237 and
documented in Table 6-30, Table 6-32 and Table 6-33. If a transceiver supports "Adaptive EQ", defined as
transceiver automatic internal control of EQ position setting (without host intervention), it can be so identified in
Byte 193 bit 3. Adaptive EQ algorithms and periodicity are implementation specific. Control of "Adaptive EQ" is done
using Upper Page 03h Byte 241 bits 3-0 (per channel controls).

The magnitude of Tx input EQ and Rx output emphasis supported by the transceiver is identified in Page 03h Byte
224. This applies to either Fixed Position Programmable or Adaptive EQ modes.

CDR status and control functions are identified in Byte 194 bits 4 to 7. If Loss of Lock indicators (flags) are
implemented bits 4 and 5 are set high. If CDR On/Off control is implemented bits 6 and 7 are set high. For
transceivers with CDR capability, setting the CDR to ON engages the internal retiming function. Setting the CDR to
OFF enables an internal bypassing mode, which directs traffic around the internal CDR. The two most common
reasons to turn a CDR off (i.e. internally bypass it) are to run at rates not supported by a particular CDR or to save
the thermal power in applications where CDR jitter mitigation is not required.

Digital Diagnostic Monitors monitor received power, bias current, supply voltage, and temperature. Additionally,
alarm and warning thresholds must be written as specified in this document. Auxiliary monitoring fields are optional
extensions to Digital Diagnostics.

All digital monitoring values must be internally calibrated and reported in the units defined in 6.2.5.

Bit 2 indicates whether a transmitted power measurement is supported. The indication is required, however, support
of transmitter power measurement is optional (see Table 6-9). If the bit is set, the transmitted power measurement
is supported, and the module will monitor the average optical power. If not, transmitted power measurement is
not supported.

Bit 3 indicates whether the received power measurement represents average input optical power or OMA. The
indication is required, however, support of received power measurement is optional (see Table 6-9). If the bit is
set, the average power is monitored. If not, received power measurement is not supported, or OMA is monitored.

To enable baud rates in excess of 25.4 GBd, an extended baud rate field has been added in byte 222 to supplement
the existing values in byte 140. Byte 140 contains baud rate at 100 MBd resolution, which is limited to 25.4 GBd.
Byte 222 contains baud rate at 250 MBd resolution, enabling up to 63.5 GBd. A value of zero means this field is
unspecified.

6.6.1 Free Side Device and Channel Thresholds (Page 03h, Bytes 128-223)
Each monitor value has a corresponding high alarm, low alarm, high warning, and low warning thresholds. For each
monitor that is implemented, high and low alarm thresholds are required. These factory-preset values allow the
user to determine when a particular value is outside of normal limits as determined by the free side device
manufacturer. It is assumed that these values will vary with different technologies and different implementations.
These values are stored in read-only memory in Page 03h Bytes 128-223.

Output amplitude and output emphasis are defined at the appropriate test points defined by the relevant standard.
There is an illustration of reference test points in SFF-8679.

Because receiver emphasis settings can affect receiver output amplitude (and vice versa) Table 6-31 and Table
6-33 define the variable parameter at a nominal condition of the other. For instance, Table 6-31 defines output
amplitude at a zero output emphasis setting and Table 6-33 defines output emphasis at a nominal output amplitude
setting (implementation dependent). The maximum emphasis supported is defined in section 0, Table 6-29 byte
224. If an implementation does not support all levels up to and including the maximum, the nearest value shall be
used.

Squelch and output control functionality is optional. If implemented, squelch and output disable is controlled for
each channel using Page 03h Bytes 231 and 240-241. Writing a '1' in the Squelch Disable register (Page 03h Byte
240) disables the squelch for the associated channel. Writing a '1' in the Output Disable register (Page 03h Byte
241) disables the output of the associated channel. When a '1' is written in both registers for a channel, the
associated output is disabled. The registers read all '0's upon power-up. Note that the Tx Forced Squelch controls
in page 03h, byte 231, override the Tx Squelch Disable settings (see Table 6-30). All other squelch functionality
details are outside the scope of this document.

Many additional parameters may be supported by a QSFP with advanced modulation techniques. Pages 20h and
21h in the SFF-8436/SFF-8636 memory space are assigned for monitoring of these parameters. The basic
monitoring techniques are the same as for other monitored parameters (i.e., they support current value, latched
warning/alarm status, masks, and thresholds). To indicate to the host device whether pages 20h and 21h are
supported, page 00h byte 195 bit 0 is used. A value of 1b indicates that page 20h and 21h are supported as
described in this section. A value of 0b indicates that pages 20h and 21h are not supported by the module.

For a PAM4 signal, several additional parameters are very useful to determine the health of the module and the
line environment. These include bit error ratio and frame error rate calculations, a signal-to-noise ratio
measurement and a level transition measurement that characterize the PAM eye, and a residual dispersion
measurement.

For a module implementing a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing optical interface, there is a significant benefit
in providing access to additional diagnostic monitoring parameters specifically for a DWDM module. In DWDM the
wavelength or frequency of the laser is an extremely important parameter and monitoring it allows the health of
the laser to be known. When a direct measurement of the error in the frequency is not available, the laser
temperature deviation from the target is often used as a proxy. In addition, DWDM modules typically use a thermo-
electric cooler (TEC) to control the laser temperature. The current flowing through the TEC is a strong indicator of
the health of the module. A warning or error indication in any of these parameters can be an early indication of
pending module failure.

Other modules may require additional parameters to be defined in the future.

It is expected that not all possible features will be supported by all modules or on all channels. To address this
situation, this specification allows the module to determine which parameters are being monitored. Some
parameters may be module-level in scope, and some may be channel-specific. This information is conveyed by the
module to the host in the 2-byte parameter configuration registers (page 20h bytes 200-248). To indicate that one
or more parameters are not supported the module reports 00h in both bytes of the configuration register for that
parameter.

Up to 24 different parameters can be monitored, each providing a real-time value as well as alarm and warning
flags. 16 threshold value sets are provided, and each of the 24 parameters is associated by the module with one
of the threshold value sets. The parameter configuration registers indicate which threshold set is to be used with
each parameter. Note that this implies that multiple parameters may share the same threshold set (for example, if
the same parameter is measured on multiple channels).

To facilitate future functionality without major specification changes, the parameter configuration registers provide
an enumerated value for the specific parameter to be monitored.

In addition to parameter monitoring, this specification includes a read-only logical mapping indication feature which
associates electrical channels with optical channels when that mapping is defined.

6.7.2.3 Mask Registers for Monitored Parameters
These 12 bytes cover the interrupt masks for the latched alarm and warning flags. Each parameter has 4 bits with
the most-significant bit representing the alarm high error, followed by low alarm, high warning and low warning as
with other alarm and warning parameters. When a particular bit is 0, then the corresponding flag generates an
interrupt. If the bit is 1 then an interrupt is not generated. As with the alarm and warning flags, for each parameter
the highest bit number represents alarm high followed by alarm low, warning high and warning low masks.

6.7.2.4 Real-Time Value of Monitored Parameters
These 48 bytes contain the real-time value of the monitored parameters. They are to be interpreted as specified in
the Parameter Configuration Registers. In addition, the module will compare these values to the corresponding
thresholds indicated in the Parameter Configuration Registers to generate the appropriate alarms and/or warnings
in the registers above. As with the rest of SFF-8636, these parameters are all stored with the most significant byte
in the lower numbered address.

6.7.2.5 Parameter Configuration Registers
These 48 bytes determine how the real-time value registers, alarms and warnings, masks and thresholds are to be
interpreted by the host. For each of the 24 possible monitored parameters the monitoring point, parameter type
and threshold location are provided by the module. The parameter configuration is a 2-byte field which is described
below.

6.7.2.6 Electrical/Optical Lane Mapping
This read-only feature allows the host to retrieve the electrical to optical channel mapping. For a PAM4 encoding,
the electrical channel can be either mapped to the MSB or the LSB of the optical channel. This parameter is read-
only. Each electrical channel has a 4-bit register in register 183 or 184 to define this mapping:

                   spread amongst any optical lane and between LSB and MSB. This may be the case for
                   example, in FEC encoded data or Gray mapped data. Use this value also to mean that lane
                   mapping is not supported.
          1        Optical Lane 1, LSB. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on
                   optical lane 1 in the LSB.
          2        Optical Lane 1, MSB. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on
                   optical lane 1 in the MSB.
          3        Optical Lane 2, LSB. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on
                   optical lane 2 in the LSB.
          4        Optical Lane 2, MSB. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on
                   optical lane 2 in the MSB.
          5        Optical Lane 1. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on optical
                   lane 1, but it might be LSB or MSB or spread between the two based on encoding.
          6        Optical Lane 2. This means that all of the data from the electrical lane appears on optical
                   lane 2, but it might be LSB or MSB or spread between the two based on encoding.

6.7.2.8 Threshold Registers
This section contains the 16 threshold register sets against which the various parameters are to be compared to
determine if an alarm or warning flag should be generated. Each threshold set has 4 2-Byte registers ordered most
significant byte-first, and the registers are in the same order as other threshold registers in SFF-8636: alarm high
threshold, alarm low threshold, warning high threshold, warning low threshold. The units of the threshold values
are identified by the corresponding parameter value which is assigned to the threshold set.

                                 Figure 6-1 Optical ingress path of Module

Figure 6-2 is a view of the aggregate PAM4 data expressed as a histogram measured at a vertical slice in the center
of the eye, showing the measurement method for SNR and level transition parameters.




                                 Figure 6-2 PAM4 vertical slice histogram

The histogram x-axis is in bins and the y-axis is in number of bin hits. The number of bins and the hit count
magnitude is vendor specific. The histogram is taken at the point in the time domain where data is converted from
analog to digital. The PAM4 slicer determines the best points to split the data between values of 0, 1, 2 or 3. The
peak is the bin with the largest number of counts between any two valleys (or below valley 1/above valley 3 for
the first and last peaks). The valley location is determined by the slicer, and is the bin number where data below
is considered to be i and data above is considered to be i+1.

       The calculations for the reported eye parameters are:
       SNR = 10* log10(min{SNR0, SNR1, SNR2 }) where SNRi= (µi+1- µi)/( σi+1+ σi), expressed in 1/256 dB
       units
       LTP = 10* log10(min{LTP0, LTP1, LTP2 }) where LTPi= (Pi+1+ Pi)/( 2Vi), expressed in 1/256 dB units

6.7.4 Detailed Description of Additional Monitored Parameters for PAM4
6.7.4.1 SNR
This feature measures the electrical signal-to-noise ratio on the ingress optical channel, as defined in Figure 6-3. It
is the minimum of the individual eye SNR values, where the SNRi for each of the three eyes is defined as the ratio
of the difference of the mean voltage between neighboring levels divided by the sum of the standard deviations of
the two neighboring levels.

SNR is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer in units of 1/256 dB. For example a value of 1380h is interpreted as
an SNR of 19.5 dB.
6.7.4.2 Residual ISI/Dispersion:
Chromatic dispersion is monitored at TP3 and will report the same value as an external dispersion meter (e.g., an
optical vector analyzer) would report. The units are 0.1 ps/nm. For the vendor specified wavelength and line width,
the accuracy of the reported Residual ISI/Dispersion parameter shall be better than +/-100 ps/nm over specified
temperature and voltage.


6.7.4.3 PAM Level Transition Parameter
This feature measures the electrical level slicer noise, as defined in Figure 6-2. It is the minimum of the individual
PAM level LTP values, where the LTP for each PAM level is defined as the average of the peak histogram intensity
of neighboring PAM levels divided by the minimum histogram intensity between them. Both the SNR and LTP
parameters measure signal-to-noise but the LTP parameter is more sensitive to a noise floor.

PAM Level Transition Parameter is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer in units of 1/256 dB. For example a value
of 3080h is interpreted as an LTP of 48.5 dB. It is possible that the minimum histogram intensity between PAM
levels is actually zero in which case this parameter would be infinite. In this case the special value of FFFFh is used.
If the parameter measures a value of greater than 255.996 dB but is not infinite, then FFFEh is used.
6.7.4.4 Error Figures
Frame error rate is reported in RS(544,514) FEC equivalent frames (see IEEE 802.3 Clause 91.5). If the actual FEC
is not RS(544,514) then the measured frame error rate is converted. So for example, if the FEC frame size is 10%
larger than the RS(544,514) FEC frame, then the reported frame error rate will be 10% higher than the measured
frame error rate. This is done so as to be able to compare frame error rates regardless of the FEC encoding
employed.

Two different error figures may be supported:

•   RS(544,514) Frame Error Rate (FER): This parameter measures the uncorrected/errored RS(544,514)
    equivalent frames per second.
•   Pre-FEC Bit Error Ratio (BER): This is the total number of errored bits that were corrected by the FEC during

    an interval divided by the total number of bits received in the interval. Note that different FEC schemes have
    different maximum pre-FEC BER requirements for a specific corrected BER maximum target.

Both the BER and the FER are monitored using the following technique:




                                Figure 6-3 Error rate accumulation intervals

The module shall collect BER/FER data over a vendor-specific fine time slice, defined by the module (for example,
1 ms). The host may read the data at a slower rate.

The module calculates a BER/FER at each fine interval (light borders). The Host may have performance monitoring
intervals (dark borders). Figure 6-3 shows a series (in time) of fine intervals punctuated by counter reset events
that demark the host monitoring interval. If supported by the module, the host can read various calculated values.
The selection of the which value(s) is/are available depends on the parameter type identifier (see Table 6-43).

Current:

If supported, the module shall keep a recent reading for the host to read at any time. This is referred to as the
“instantaneous” value. For this value, a parameter type (See Table 6-43) of 12 for BER or 15 for FER is used.

Average:

If supported by the module, the average value shall be determined by using the counters reset function to program
the averaging time interval. The module shall report a continuously averaged reading over the entire averaging
interval. For this value, a parameter type of 4 for BER or 5 for FER is used. This value provides a glimpse as to how
the current monitoring interval is performing. The module shall reset the counters for this purpose upon a write of
1b to register 250, bit 7 on page 20h.

Prior Period:

This value is the total averaged in the last monitoring interval as defined by the two most recent counter reset
events. This is provided to assure that an interval can be calculated regardless of how quickly the host is reading
the data.

If supported, the module shall allow the host to continue to read the BER/FER that was averaged between the last
two counter reset events (i.e. between the two dark lines in Figure 6-3). For this value, a parameter type of 12 for
BER and 16 for FER is used. The module shall reset the counters for this purpose upon a write of 1b to register
250, bit 7 on page 20h.

Latched Maximum/Maximum:

This is the largest/smallest fine-interval calculation since the last time the host read the data. The host can then

keep track of the maximum of these readings to report as an overall maximum/minimum within its performance
monitoring interval.

If supported, the module shall latch the lowest and highest (respectively) measurements it has calculated over any
fine interval since the last time the host read each value. The module shall clear the corresponding latch when the
host reads the value. These values are not cleared with the counters reset feature. For these values, a parameter
type of 9 for BER minimum, 10 for BER maximum, 13 for FER minimum, and 15 for FER maximum is used.

Note that the thresholds system is maintained for BER and FER, but the low thresholds should be 0, and the high
threshold for FER should also be 0 unless other error correcting schemes are present.

The error parameters are interpreted as an unsigned 16-bit floating point number with 5 bits for base-10 exponent,
offset by -24, and 11 bits for mantissa. Thus the format is:
                                                𝑚𝑚 ∗ 10𝑠𝑠+𝑜𝑜
Where m ranges from 0 to 2047 (11 bits), s ranges from 0 to 31 (5 bits) and o is fixed at -24. The smallest non-
zero number is m=1 and s=0 or 1*10^(-24). The largest number supported is m=2047 and s=31, or 2.047*10^10.
Within the 2 bytes of the value (stored lowest byte first), m and s are encoded as follows:

6.7.5 Detailed Description of Additional Monitored Parameters for DWDM
6.7.5.1 TC Current
If supported, this parameter monitors the amount of current flowing to the TC of a cooled laser.

It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 0.1 mA. Thus the total range is from -3.2768 A to
+3.2767 A.


6.7.5.2 Laser Frequency
If supported, this parameter monitors the difference (in frequency units) between the target center frequency and
the actual current center frequency. It is a similar measurement to the Laser Temperature except expressed as a
frequency difference instead of a temperature difference, and vendors may support one or the other measurement,
or both.

It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 10 MHz. Thus the total range is from -327.68 GHz to
327.67 GHz.
6.7.5.3 Laser Temperature
If supported, this parameter monitors the laser temperature difference between the target laser temperature for a
cooled laser, and the actual current temperature. It is a similar measurement to the Frequency Error except
expressed as a temperature difference instead of a frequency difference, and vendors may support one or the other
measurement, or both.

It is a 16-bit signed 2s complement value in increments of 1/256 °C. Thus the total range is from -128 °C to
+128 °C.

A Appendix A. Rate Select and Configuration for Multi-rate Modules
  (Informative)
The host system (fixed-side) can use the management interface to reconfigure modules (free-side) to operate at
different rates or to comply with different specifications. One method of reconfiguration is for the host to write
directly, one at a time, to the various controls provided by the module. Alternatively the module may offer optional
rate select controls whereby the host writes to a single location and the module firmware makes all necessary
adjustments to change operation from one rate to another.

When rate select controls are provided, the module may automatically make changes to the Tx and Rx datapath
components, including the ability to:

        •       Enable/Disable (bypass) Tx and Rx CDRs
        •       Enable/Disable/Adjust Tx input equalizers and set fixed or adaptive modes of operation
        •       Enable/Disable/Adjust Rx output emphasis and Rx output amplitude
        •       Adjust the bandwidth and/or gain of internal components

Various advertising bits state which optional features are implemented by a module. Key bits for this discussion
are:

A.1 Direct Control Configuration
The host system can directly control the CDRs, Tx Input Equalizers, Rx Output Emphasis and Rx Output Amplitude
if those options are implemented by the module. After checking the various advertising bits, the host can control
these features using the control bits at:

Note that CDRs and Tx input equalizers are designed for operation at the maximum rate specified for the module.
For module operation at low rates, the host may need to disable Tx and Rx CDRs and set the Tx input equalizers
for 0 dB of equalization.


A.2 Rate Select
If rate select is supported by a module, the host can set up the module for a desired rate using the Tx and Rx rate
select control bits (bytes 87-88). There are several advertising bits that tell the host whether the module supports
rate select, and which types of rate select are available.

Table A-1 summarizes the advertising bits related to Rate Select support.

If the module supports rate select the host can change configuration by using the rate select controls at:

Page 00h, bytes 87-88: Tx and Rx Rate Select control bits

The module is responsible for making all necessary adjustments for operation at the selected rate. These
adjustments may include changes to Tx and Rx bandwidths, changes in CDR operation, and adjustments to
equalizer, emphasis and amplitude settings, without requiring the host to write those control bits.

If the module makes adjustments to these settings there is no requirement for the module firmware to change the
related control bits. For example, if the module bypasses the Tx or Rx CDRs in order to operate at a reduced rate,
byte 98 may still be set to show the CDRs enabled.


A.3 Extended Rate Selection
If one of the extended rate select versions is supported, as listed in Table A-2, then the host can use bytes 87-88
to optimize the Tx and Rx data paths for particular signaling rates. Two bits are assigned to each receiver in Byte
87 (Rxn_Rate_Select) and two bits for each transmitter in Byte 88 (Txn_Rate_Select) to specify up to four signaling
rates.
