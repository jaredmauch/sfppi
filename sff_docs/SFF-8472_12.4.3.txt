      Rev.                                    Description                                            Date

     12.4.2   Added/modify new sections 11, 12, 13 and 14.                                        2023-05-08

              Added accepted comment reviews to Rev 12.4.
                 - A2:118.1 – added note for PL4 power level 4. (Comment Review #68)
                 - Section 10.4 in Rev 12.4 has been moved to Section 11 in Rev 12.5

              Two more comments from comment review needs to be addressed. When to
              indicate module in state 4, request is to indicate when module has reached
              steady state in power level 4, and not when module is entering power level 4.

              Other comment is Page 00h / 01h are they mirror (same information) or do
              they relay different pages, like two pages of data.

              Applied new text to previous document Rev 12.4 Section 10.4, clarifying Pg
              00h/01h, per meeting on 2023-05-06 discussion. This will be in Section 11.1
              in this revision.

              Changes to 12.4.1 after review, Section 13.
                 - Change nsec to ns, atto-seconds to appropriately scaled fs (femto-
                     seconds)
                 - Remove “Magic Number” replace with Format ID in section 13.
                 - Change 0xABCD to ABCDh. (Editorial)
                 - Updated section 13 for consistency, clarification.
                 - Added description of Calibration Loopback Module.

              Added Appendix Section 14 to supplement Section 12.
     12.4.3   Update from comment reviews (about 140 comments).                                   2025-03-04

              Changed Section 2 and 3 per comment review to copy from SFF-8636. Added
              Glossary, Definitions

              Per comment review remote section 14 and moved to Section 12.4.

              Section 13 High Accuracy Timing and Tight-Sync merge. Newer definition of
              memory map compared to draft revision 12.4.2.

 1   1 Scope
 2   This document defines a memory map and digital management interface for monitoring and control of SFP+ optical
 3   transceivers and similar modules.
 4
 5   The interface is an extension of the 2-wire interface ID interface defined in the GBIC specification as well as the SFP
 6   MSA. Both specifications define a 256 byte memory map which is accessible over a 2-wire serial interface at the 8 bit
 7   address 1010000X (A0h). The enhanced digital management interface makes use of the 8 bit address 1010001X
 8   (A2h), so the originally defined 2-wire interface ID memory map remains unchanged. The interface is backward
 9   compatible with both the GBIC specification and the SFP MSA.
10
11   In order to provide memory space for future extensions, multiple optional pages are defined for the upper 128 bytes
12   of the A2h memory space.

 1   2.3     Conventions
 2
 3   The following conventions are used throughout this document:
 4
 5   DEFINITIONS: Certain words and terms used in this standard have a specific meaning beyond the normal English
 6   meaning. These words and terms are defined either in the definitions or in the text where they first appear.
 7
 8   ORDER OF PRECEDENCE: If a conflict arises between text, tables, or figures, the order of precedence to resolve
 9   the conflicts is text; then tables; and finally figures. Not all tables or figures are fully described in the text. Tables show
10   data format and values.
11
12   NUMBERING CONVENTIONS: The ISO convention of numbering is used (i.e., the thousands and higher multiples
13   are separated by a space and a period is used as the decimal point). This is equivalent to the English/American
14   convention of a comma and a period.
15

16
17   NUMERALS CONSTANTS: Numerals without suffix are understood as numbers in decimal notation (e.g. 16).
18   Hexadecimal literals are marked with a suffix ‘h’ (e.g. 10h), often written with leading zeroes (0010h). Binary literals
19   are marked with a suffix ‘b’ (e.g. 10000b), often written with leading zeroes (00010000b). The suffixes may be omitted
20   for unambiguous cases like 0=0b=0h and 1=1b=1h. Spaces may be inserted to make long hexadecimal or binary
21   digit strings readable (e.g. 0001 0000b).

 2   4.1       Introduction
 3
 4   The enhanced digital diagnostic interface is a superset of the MOD_DEF interface defined in the SFP MSA document
 5   dated September 14, 2000, later submitted to the SFF Committee as INF-8074. The 2-wire interface pin definitions,
 6   hardware, and timing was initially defined there. SFF-8431, later superseded by SFF-8419 define the low speed
 7   electrical and management interface specifications for SFP+. Pluggable modules such as SFP+, SFP28 and future
 8   SFP form factor that are compliant to SFF-8431 and SFF-8419 hereafter referred to as SFP+ may use this
 9   management interface.
10
11   This document describes an extension to the memory map defined in the SFP MSA (see Figure 4-1). The enhanced
12   interface uses the 2-wire serial bus address 1010001X, commonly referred to as A2h, and where X can be 1 for a
13   read operation or 0 for a write operation. Reads from this address provide diagnostic information about the module's
14   present operating conditions. The transceiver generates this diagnostic data by digitization of internal analog signals.
15   Calibration and alarm/warning threshold data is written during device manufacture.
16
17   All bits that are reserved for SFF-8472 shall be set to zero and/or ignored.
18
19   Bits labeled as reserved or optional for other usage, such as for SFF-8079, shall be implemented per such other
20   documents, or set to zero and/or ignored if not implemented.
21
22   If optional features for SFF-8472 are implemented, they shall be implemented as defined in SFF-8472. If they are
23   not implemented or not applicable to the device, then write bits shall be ignored, and status bits shall be set to zero.
24
25   Additional A0h and A2h memory allocations were provided in revision 9.5 to support multi-rate and application
26   selection as defined in the SFF-8079 and SFF-8089 specifications.
27   Various extensions have been made in revisions since revision 10.4. These include adding new connectors, industry
28   form factors, transceiver codes and controls for transceiver features.

 4   The optional Page Select byte expands the range of information that can be provided by the manufacturer. Where
 5   used in this specification the Page ID is defined in hexadecimal. Note: Vendor Specific Page IDs may be password-
 6   protected. The location of the password is not defined in SFF-8472 and will be defined by the vendor.
 7
 8   The use of Paging System is Optional, and when used the pages shall be used as described in the following table.
 9
10   In this revision, see Table 8-3, A0h.Byte65.Bit0, which was previously reserved in SFF-8472 Rev 12.4, is now used
11   to indicate that there are additional pages. If this bit is 0b, then the transceiver module has only legacy pages 00/01
12   and 02h. If this bit is 1b, there are one or more additional pages to be discovered. To discover if a page is supported,
13   the host writes A2h.Byte127 (Page Select) byte, wait momentarily until the page change is complete and then read-
14   back the page select byte. If the page is supported then the page select byte will return what is being written,
15   otherwise it will return 00h. Once the page has been selected, there may need to be additional validations that
16   needs to be performed with the page, for example for Page 03h, the first 2 bytes, byte 128-129 are format ID as
17   well as the last byte being CC_CALIB, a checksum. This is to ensure that modules that are non-compliant to the
18   additional page description are appropriately managed.

23     4.3.1 Remote Transceiver Pages
24
25   In SFF-8472 Rev 12.5 and above, if the optional Remote Performance Monitoring (RPM) feature is supported as
26   described in Section 12.3, a remote transceiver’s memory map pages are presented and accessible at the local pages
27   20h-27h. The content of these pages is identical to the page definition of their respective mapped pages however
28   the host shall account for the time delays for the RPM system to update this content.
29
30   As an example, to access the remote transceiver’s A2h Page 02h, read from Page 22h. One method of obtaining
31   remote transceivers data is defined by MOPA “Remote Monitoring Specifications v1.0 or later revisions”.

           550 m for 50 um / 500 MHz*km cable.
       3. For transceivers supporting multiple data rates (and hence multiple distances with a single fiber type) the
           highest data rate and the distances achievable at that data rate are to be identified in these fields.
       4. In this example, the transceiver supports 400-M5-SN-I, 200-M5-SN-I, 100-M5-SN-I, 400-M6-SN-I, 200-M6-
           SN-I and 100-M6-SN-I.
       5. These target distances are for classification and not for specification.

2    The extended identifier value provides additional information about the transceiver. The field should be set to 04h
3    for all SFP modules indicating 2-wire interface ID module definition. In many cases, a GBIC elects to use MOD_DEF
4    4 to make additional information about the GBIC available, even though the GBIC is actually compliant with one of
5    the six other MOD_DEF values defined for GBICs. The extended identifier allows the GBIC to explicitly specify such
6    compliance without requiring the MOD_DEF value to be inferred from the other information provided.

    NOTES:
    1. Bit 7 is the high order bit and is transmitted first in each byte.
    2. SONET compliance codes require reach specifier bits 3 and 4 in Table 5-4 to completely specify transceiver capabilities.
    3. Ethernet LX, PX and BX compliance codes require the use of the Signaling Rate, Nominal value (byte 12), link length
        values for single-mode and two types of multimode fiber (Bytes 14-17) and wavelength value for the laser (Bytes 60 and
        61) as specified in Table 4-2 to completely specify transceiver capabilities. See Table 4-4 and Table 5-6 for examples of
        setting values for these parameters.
    4. Open Fiber Control (OFC) is a legacy eye safety electrical interlock system implemented on Gigabit Link Module (GLM)
        type transceiver devices and is not considered relevant to SFP transceivers.
    5. Laser type "LL" (long length) is usually associated with 1550 nm, narrow spectral width lasers capable of very long link
        lengths.
    6. Laser type "LC" (low cost) is usually associated with 1310 nm lasers capable of medium to long link lengths.

 2        5.4.1 SONET Reach Specifier Bits [Address A0h, Byte 4, bits 3-4]
 3      The SONET compliance code bits allow the host to determine with which specifications a SONET transceiver complies.
 4      For each rate defined in Table 5-3 (OC-3, OC-12, OC-48), SONET specifies short reach (SR), intermediate reach (IR),
 5      and long reach (LR) requirements. For each of the three rates, a single short reach (SR) specification is defined. Two
 6      variations of intermediate reach (IR-1, IR-2) and three variations of long reach (LR-1, LR-2, and LR-3) are also
 7      defined for each rate. Byte 4, bits 0-2, and byte 5, bits 0-7 allow the user to determine which of the three reaches
 8      has been implemented - short, intermediate, or long. Two additional 'specifier' bits (byte 4, bits 3-4) are necessary
 9      to discriminate between different intermediate or long reach variations.

         2.125 GBd and 1.0625 GBd.
     2. To distinguish between 1000BASE-LX and 1000BASE-LX10, A0h Bytes 12 to 18 must be used. See Table 4-2
         and Table 4-3 for more information.

      4. For Ethernet and SONET applications, rate capability of a link is identified in A0h Byte 12 [nominal signaling rate
          identifier]. This is due to no formal IEEE designation for passive and active cable interconnects, and lack of
          corresponding identifiers in Table 5-3.

2    5.5     Encoding [Address A0h, Byte 11]
3    The encoding value indicates the encoding mechanism that is the nominal design target of the particular transceiver.
4    The value shall be contained in the 2-wire interface data. These values are maintained in the Transceiver or Cable
5    Management section of SFF-8024.

 7   5.6     Signaling rate, nominal [Address A0h, Byte 12]
 8   The nominal signaling rate is specified in units of 100 MBd, rounded off to the nearest 100 MBd. The signaling rate
 9   includes those bits necessary to encode and delimit the signal as well as those bits carrying data information. A value
10   of FFh indicates the signaling rate is greater than 25.4 GBd and addresses 66 and 67 are used to determine the
11   signaling rate. A value of 0 indicates that the signaling rate is not specified and must be determined from the
12   transceiver technology. The actual information transfer rate will depend on the encoding of the data, as defined by
13   the encoding value.

 6   The laser wavelength is equal to the 16-bit integer value in nm. This field allows the user to read the laser wavelength
 7   directly, so it is not necessary to infer it from the Transceiver Codes A0h Bytes 3 to 10 (see Table 5-3). This also
 8   allows specification of wavelengths not covered in the Transceiver Codes, such as those used in coarse WDM systems.

10   For passive and active cable variants, a value of 00h for both A0h Byte 60 and Byte 61 denotes laser wavelength or
11   cable specification compliance is unspecified.

16   8.8     Diagnostic Monitoring Type [Address A0h, Byte 92]
17   "Diagnostic Monitoring Type" is a one-byte field with 8 single bit indicators describing how diagnostic monitoring is
18   implemented in the particular transceiver.
19
20   Note that if bit 6, address 92 is set indicating that digital diagnostic monitoring has been implemented, received
21   power monitoring, transmitted power monitoring, bias current monitoring, supply voltage monitoring and
22   temperature monitoring must all be implemented. Additionally, alarm and warning thresholds must be written as
23   specified in this document at locations 00 to 55 on 2-wire serial address 1010001X (A2h) (see Table 8-5).
24
25   Two calibration options are possible if bit 6 has been set indicating that digital diagnostic monitoring has been
26   implemented. If bit 5, "Internally calibrated", is set, the transceiver directly reports calibrated values in units of
27   current, power etc. If bit 4, "Externally calibrated", is set, the reported values are A/D counts which must be converted
28   to real world units using calibration values read using 2-wire serial address 1010001X (A2h) from bytes 56 to 95. See
29   "Diagnostics" section for details.
30
31   Bit 3 indicates whether the received power measurement represents average input optical power or OMA. If the bit
32   is set, average power is monitored. If it is not, OMA is monitored.

1    8.9     Addressing Modes
2    Bit 2 indicates whether or not it is necessary for the host to perform an address change sequence before accessing
3    information at 2-wire serial address A2h. If this bit is not set, the host may simply read from either address, A0h or
4    A2h, by using that value in the address byte during the 2-wire communication sequence. If the bit is set, the following
5    sequence must be executed prior to accessing information at address A2h. Once A2h has been accessed, it will be
6    necessary to execute the address change sequence again prior to reading from A0h. The address change sequence
7    is defined as the following steps on the 2-wire serial interface:
8
      1)      Host controller generates a Start condition, followed by address of 0b00000000.
              Note that the R/W bit of this address indicates transfer from host to device (‘0'b).
      2)      Device responds with Ack
      3)      Host controller transfers 0b00000100 (04h) as the next 8 bits of data
               This value indicates that the device is to change its address
      4)      Device responds with Ack
      5)      Host controller transfers one of the following values as the next 8 bits of data:
               0bXXXXXX00 - specifies 2-wire interface ID memory page
               0bXXXXXX10 - specifies Digital Diagnostic memory page
      6)      Device responds with Ack
      7)      Host controller generates a Stop condition
      8)      Device changes address that it responds to, based on the Step 5 byte value above:
              0bXXXXXX00 - address becomes 0b1010000X (A0h)
              0bXXXXXX10 - address becomes 0b1010001X (A2h)

12   8.10 Enhanced Options [Address A0h, Byte 93]
13   The Enhanced Options are a one-byte field with 8 single bit indicators which describe the optional digital diagnostic
14   features implemented in the transceiver. Since transceivers do not necessarily implement all optional features
15   described in this document, this field allows the host to determine which functions are available over the 2-wire serial
16   bus. A '1' indicates that the particular function is implemented in the transceiver. Bits 3 and 6 of byte 110 (see Table
17   9-16 ) allow the host to control the Rate_Select and TX_Disable functions. If these functions are not implemented,
18   the bits remain readable and writable, but the transceiver ignores them.
19
20   Note that "soft" functions of TX_DISABLE, TX_FAULT, RX_LOS, and RATE_SELECT do not meet timing requirements
21   as specified in the SFP MSA section B3 "Timing Requirements of Control and Status I/O" and the GBIC Specification,
22   revision 5.5, (SFF-8053), section 5.3.1, for their corresponding pins. The soft functions allow a host to poll or set
23   these values over the 2-wire interface bus as an alternative to monitoring/setting pin values. Timing is vendor specific
24   but must meet the requirements specified in Table 8-7. Asserting either the "hard pin" or "soft bit" (or both) for
25   TX_DISABLE or RATE_SELECT results in that function being asserted.

10   9 Diagnostics
11   9.1     Overview [Address A2h]
12   2-wire serial bus address 1010001X (A2h) is used to access measurements of transceiver temperature, internally
13   measured supply voltage, TX bias current, TX output power, received optical power, and two optional DWDM
14   quantities: laser temperature, and TEC current.
15
16   The values are interpreted differently depending upon the option bits set at address 92. If bit 5 "internally calibrated"
17   is set, the values are calibrated absolute measurements, which should be interpreted according to the section
18   "Internal Calibration" below. If bit 4 "externally calibrated" is set, the values are A/D counts, which are converted
19   into real units per the subsequent section titled "External Calibration". The optional DWDM quantities are defined
20   for internal calibration only.
21
22   Measured parameters are reported in 16-bit data fields, i.e., two concatenated bytes. The 16-bit data fields allow for
23   wide dynamic range. This is not intended to imply that a 16-bit A/D system is recommended or required in order to
24   achieve the accuracy goals stated below. The width of the data field should not be taken to imply a given level of
25   precision. It is conceivable that the accuracy goals herein can be achieved with less than 16 bits of resolution. It is
26   recommended that any low-order data bits beyond the specified accuracy be fixed at zero. Overall system accuracy
27   and precision is vendor dependent.
28
29   To guarantee coherency of the diagnostic monitoring data, the host is required to retrieve any multi-byte fields from
30   the diagnostic monitoring data structure (e.g. Rx Power MSB - byte 104 in A2h, Rx Power LSB - byte 105 in A2h) by
31   the use of a single two-byte read sequence across the 2-wire interface.
32
33   The transceiver is required to ensure that any multi-byte fields which are updated with diagnostic monitoring data
34   (e.g. Rx Power MSB - byte 104 in A2h, Rx Power LSB - byte 105 in A2h) must have this update done in a fashion
35   that guarantees coherency and consistency of the data. In other words, the update of a multi-byte field by the
36   transceiver must not occur such that a partially updated multi-byte field can be transferred to the host. Also, the
37   transceiver shall not update a multi-byte field within the structure during the transfer of that multi-byte field to the
38   host, such that partially updated data would be transferred to the host.

1    Accuracy requirements specified below shall apply to the operating signal range specified in the relevant standard.
2    The manufacturer's specification should be consulted for more detail on the conditions under which the accuracy
3    requirements are met.

4    9.2     Internal Calibration
5    Measurements are calibrated over vendor specified operating temperature and voltage and should be interpreted as
6    defined below. Alarm and warning threshold values should be interpreted in the same manner as real time 16-bit
7    data.
8
      1)   Internally measured transceiver temperature. Represented as a 16-bit signed twos complement value in
           increments of 1/256 degrees Celsius, yielding a total range of -128°C to +128°C. Temperature accuracy is
           vendor specific but must be better than ±3 degrees over the specified operating temperature and voltage.
           Please see vendor specification for details on location of temperature sensor. See Table 9-1 and Table 9-2
           below for examples of temperature format.
      2)   Internally measured transceiver supply voltage. Represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the voltage
           defined as the full 16-bit value (0-65535) with LSB equal to 100 uV, yielding a total range of 0 V to +6.55 V.
           Practical considerations to be defined by transceiver manufacturer tend to limit the actual bounds of the
           supply voltage measurement. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than ±3% of the manufacturer's
           nominal value over specified operating temperature and voltage. Note that in some transceivers, transmitter
           supply voltage and receiver supply voltage are isolated. In that case, only one supply is monitored. Refer to
           the device specification for more detail.
      3)   Measured TX bias current in uA. Represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the current defined as the full
           16-bit value (0-65535) with LSB equal to 2 uA, yielding a total range of 0 to 131 mA. Accuracy is vendor
           specific but must be better than ±10% of the manufacturer's nominal value over specified operating
           temperature and voltage.
      4)   Measured TX output power in mW. Represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the power defined as the
           full 16-bit value (0-65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 uW, yielding a total range of 0 to 6.5535 mW (~ -40 to +8.2
           dBm). Data is assumed to be based on measurement of laser monitor photodiode current. It is factory
           calibrated to absolute units using the most representative fiber output type. Accuracy is vendor specific but
           must be better than ±3 dB over the specified temperature and voltage. Data is not valid when the transmitter
           is disabled.
      5)   Measured RX received optical power in mW. Value can represent either average received power or OMA
           depending upon how bit 3 of byte 92 (A0h) is set. Represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer with the power
           defined as the full 16-bit value (0-65535) with LSB equal to 0.1 uW, yielding a total range of 0 to 6.5535 mW
           (~ -40 to +8.2 dBm). Absolute accuracy is dependent upon the exact optical wavelength. For the vendor
           specified wavelength, accuracy shall be better than ±3 dB over specified temperature and voltage. This
           accuracy shall be maintained for input power levels up to the lesser of maximum transmitted or maximum
           received optical power per the appropriate standard. It shall be maintained down to the minimum transmitted
           power minus cable plant loss (insertion loss or passive loss) per the appropriate standard. Absolute accuracy
           beyond this minimum required received input optical power range is vendor specific.
      6)   Measured optional laser temperature. For DWDM applications bytes 106-107 report laser temperature. The
           encoding is the same as for transceiver internal temperature defined in paragraph 1) above. The relative
           and absolute accuracy are vendor specific but relative laser temperature accuracy must be better than +/-
           0.2 degrees Celsius. [Relative temperature accuracy refers to the accuracy of the reported temperature
           changes relative to the actual laser temperature changes].
      7)   Measured TEC current. For DWDM applications, bytes 108-109 report the measured TEC current. The format
           is signed two’s complement with the LSB equal to 0.1 mA. Thus a range from -3276.8 to +3276.7 mA may
           be reported with a resolution of 0.1 mA. See Table 9-4 and Table 9-5 for further details. Reported TEC
           current is a positive number for cooling and a negative number for heating. The accuracy of the TEC current
           monitor is vendor specific but shall be be better than +/- 15% of the maximum TEC current as stored in the
           TEC current high alarm threshold (bytes 48-49).

1    9.3     External Calibration
2    Measurements are raw A/D values and must be converted to real world units using calibration constants stored in
3    EEPROM locations 56-95 at 2-wire serial bus address A2h. Calibration is valid over vendor specified operating
4    temperature and voltage. Alarm and warning threshold values should be interpreted in the same manner as real time
5    16-bit data.
6
7    After calibration per the equations given below for each variable, the results are consistent with the accuracy and
8    resolution goals for internally calibrated devices.
9
      1)   Internally measured transceiver temperature. Module temperature, T, is given by the following equation:

                   T(C) = T_slope * T_AD (16 bit signed twos complement value) + T_offset

           The result is in units of 1/256°C, yielding a total range of -128°C to +128°C. See Table 9-6 for locations of
           T_slope and T_offset. Temperature accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than +/-3 degrees Celsius
           over specified operating temperature and voltage. Please see vendor specification sheet for details on location
           of temperature sensor. Table 9-1 and Table 9-2 give examples of the 16-bit signed twos complement
           temperature format.
      2)   Internally measured supply voltage. Module internal supply voltage, V, is given in microvolts by the following
           equation:

                   V(uV) = V_slope * V_AD (16-bit unsigned integer) + V_offset

           The result is in units of 100 uV, yielding a total range of 0 to 6.55 V. See Table 9-6 for locations of V_slope
           and V_offset. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than +/-3% of the manufacturer's nominal value
           over specified operating temperature and voltage. Note that in some transceivers, transmitter supply voltage
           and receiver supply voltage are isolated. In that case, only one supply is monitored. Refer to the
           manufacturer's specification for more detail.
      3)   Measured transmitter laser bias current. Module laser bias current, I, is given in microamps by the following
           equation:

                   I (uA) = I_slope * I_AD (16 bit unsigned integer) + I_offset

           This result is in units of 2 uA, yielding a total range of 0 to 131 mA. See Table 9-6 for locations of I_slope
           and I_offset. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than +/-10% of the manufacturer's nominal
           value over specified operating temperature and voltage.
      4)   Measured coupled TX output power. Module transmitter coupled output power, TX_PWR, is given in uW by
           the following equation:

                   TX_PWR (uW) = TX_PWR_slope * TX_PWR_AD (16-bit unsigned integer) + TX_PWR_offset.

           This result is in units of 0.1uW yielding a total range of 0 to 6.5 mW. See Table 9-6 for locations of
           TX_PWR_slope and TX_PWR_offset. Accuracy is vendor specific but must be better than +/-3 dB over
           specified operating temperature and voltage. Data is assumed to be based on measurement of a laser monitor
           photodiode current. It is factory calibrated to absolute units using the most representative fiber output type.
           Data is not valid when the transmitter is disabled.

      5)   Measured received optical power. Received power, RX_PWR, is given in uW by the following equation:

           Rx_PWR (uW) =        Rx_PWR(4) * Rx_PWR_ADe4 (16 bit unsigned integer) +
                                Rx_PWR(3) * Rx_PWR_ADe3 (16 bit unsigned integer) +
                                Rx_PWR(2) * Rx_PWR_ADe2 (16 bit unsigned integer) +
                                Rx_PWR(1) * Rx_PWR_AD (16 bit unsigned integer) +
                                Rx_PWR(0)

           The result is in units of 0.1 uW yielding a total range of 0 to 6.5 mW. See Table 9-6 for locations of Rx_PWR(4-
           0). Absolute accuracy is dependent upon the exact optical wavelength. For the vendor specified wavelength,
           accuracy shall be better than +/-3 dB over specified temperature and voltage. This accuracy shall be
           maintained for input power levels up to the lesser of maximum transmitted or maximum received optical
           power per the appropriate standard. It shall be maintained down to the minimum transmitted power minus
           cable plant loss (insertion loss or passive loss) per the appropriate standard. Absolute accuracy beyond this
           minimum required received input optical power range is vendor specific.

 2   9.4     Alarm and Warning Thresholds [Address A2h, Bytes 0-39]
 3   Each A/D quantity has a corresponding high alarm, low alarm, high warning and low warning threshold. These factory
 4   preset values allow the user to determine when a particular value is outside of "normal" limits as determined by the
 5   transceiver manufacturer. It is assumed that these values vary with different technologies and different
 6   implementations. When external calibration is used, data may be compared to alarm and warning threshold values
 7   before or after calibration by the host. Comparison can be done directly before calibration. If comparison is to be
 8   done after calibration, calibration must first be applied to both data and threshold values.
 9
10   The values reported in the alarm and warning thresholds area (see below) may be temperature compensated or
11   otherwise adjusted when setting warning and/or alarm flags. Any threshold compensation or adjustment is vendor
12   specific and optional. See Vendor's data sTt for use of alarm and warning thresholds.

 7   The slope constants at addresses 76, 80,84, and 88, are unsigned fixed-point binary numbers. The slope will therefore
 8   always be positive. The binary point is in between the upper and lower bytes, i.e., between the eighth and ninth
 9   most significant bits. The most significant byte is the integer portion in the range 0 to +255. The least significant
10   byte represents the fractional portion in the range of 0.00391 (1/256) to 0.9961 (255/256). The smallest real number
11   that can be represented by this format is 0.00391 (1/256); the largest real number that can be represented using
12   this format is 255.9961 (255 + 255/256). Slopes are defined, and conversion formulas found, in the "External
13   Calibration" section. Examples of this format are illustrated below:

10   External calibration of received optical power makes use of single-precision floating-point numbers as defined by
11   IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic, IEEE Std 754. Briefly, this format utilizes four bytes (32 bits) to represent
12   real numbers. The first and most significant bit is the sign bit; the next eight bits indicate an exponent (base 2) in
13   the range of +126 to -127; the remaining 23 bits represent the mantissa. The 32 bits are therefore arranged as in
14   the following table.

      NOTE:
      1. To support legacy modules that do not have the RS0/RS1 Pin State Ignore bit, the host needs to set the
      hardware rate select pins to a correct state.
      2. If both options are supported, as advertised in bits 3-2, register 56, it is recommended that the host sets the
      squelch method based on knowledge of the relevant interface standard.

 5   9.9     Alarm and Warning Flag Bits [Address A2h, Bytes 112-117]
 6   Bytes 112 to 117 contain an optional set of alarm and warning flags. The flags may be latched or non-latched.
 7   Implementation is vendor specific, and the Vendor's specification sheet should be consulted for details. It is
 8   recommended that in either case, detection of an asserted flag bit should be verified by a second read of the flag at
 9   least 100 ms later. For users who do not wish to set their own threshold values or read the values in locations 0-55,
10   the flags alone can be monitored. Two flag types are defined.
11       1. Alarm flags associated with transceiver temperature, supply voltage, TX bias current, TX output power and
12            received optical power as well as reserved locations for future flags. Alarm flags indicate conditions likely to
13            be associated with an in-operational link and cause for immediate action.
14       2. Warning flags associated with transceiver temperature, supply voltage, TX bias current, TX output power
15            and received optical power as well as reserved locations for future flags. Warning flags indicate conditions
16            outside the normally guaranteed bounds but not necessarily causes of immediate link failures. Certain
17            warning flags may also be defined by the manufacturer as end-of-life indicators (such as for higher than
18            expected bias currents in a constant power control loop).

                                         See Table 8-7 for timing requirements. Default at power up is 0/low, unless
                                         specifically redefined by value selected in Table 5-6. If Soft RS(1) is not
                                         implemented, the transceiver ignores the value of this bit. Note: Specific
                                         transceiver behaviors of this bit are identified in Table 5-6 and referenced

                                         Value of zero indicates Power Level 1 operation (1.0 W max).
                                         Value of one indicates Power Level 2 or 3 or 4 operation (1.5 W or 2.0 W
                                         or > 2.0 W max), depending on the values in byte 64 of A0h.
                                         Refer to Table 8-3 for Power Level requirement declaration.
                                         Refer to Table 8-7 for timing.

                                         In Power Level 4 modules, this bit shall be set when all internal circuits are
                                         powered and the module has reached steady state. For example, if TxDIS
                                         is asserted (laser off), this bit 118.1 shall be asserted (=1b) when the laser
                                         is stabilized by the TEC even there is no optical TX power. If TxDIS is de-
                                         asserted, then this bit 118.1 shall be asserted when laser is stabilized by
                                         the TEC and optical power output is present.

                                         Value of zero enables Power Level 1 only (1.0 W max).
                                         Value of one enables Power Level 2 or 3 (1.5 W or 2.0 W max), depending
                                         on the values in byte 64 of A0h.
                                         Refer to Table 8-3 for Power Level requirement declaration.
                                         Refer to Table 8-7 for timing.
                                         If Power Levels 2 or 3 are not implemented, the SFP ignores the value of
                                         this bit.

12   10.3 Optional Page Select Byte [Address A2h, Byte 127]
13   In order to provide memory space for DWDM and CDR control functions and for other potential extensions, multiple
14   Pages can be defined for the upper half of the A2h address space. At startup the value of byte 127 defaults to 00h,
15   which points to the User EEPROM. This ensures backward compatibility for transceivers that do not implement the
16   optional Page structure. When a Page value is written to byte 127, subsequent reads and writes to bytes 128-255
17   are made to the relevant Page.
18
19   This specification defines functions in Pages 00h to 02h. Pages 03h to 7Fh are reserved for future use. Writing the
20   value of a non-supported Page shall not be accepted by the transceiver. The Page Select byte shall revert to 0 and
21   read / write operations shall be to the unpaged A2h memory map.
22
23   Pages 80h-FFh are reserved for vendor specific functions.

3    The upper memory address from 128-247 in page A2h is a legacy page defined before the optional paging byte in
4    A2h byte had been defined. To maintain backward compatibility with existing modules both pages 00h and 01h or a
5    module that does not support paging shall implement the following features described in this section below
6       • 120 bytes of User EEPROM
7       • 8 bytes of vendor specific control functions

11
12   For transceivers that do not support pages, or if the Page Select byte is written to 00h, addresses 128-247 represent
13   120 bytes of user/host writable non-volatile memory - for any reasonable use. Consult module vendor datasheets for
14   any limits on writing to these locations, including timing and maximum number of writes. Potential usage includes
15   customer specific identification information, usage history statistics, scratch space for calculations, etc. It is generally
16   not recommended this memory be used for latency critical or repetitive uses. For transceivers that support page
17   01h, when the Page Select byte is written to 01h, addresses 128-247 may address the same data as in page 00h, or
18   may represent an additional 120 bytes of user/host writable non-volatile memory. Consult vendor datasheets to
19   determine which of these options is used.

 7   Table 12-3 defines registers that controls the variable receiver decision threshold function. The availability of this
 8   function is indicated in address A0h, byte 65, bit 7. There are two behaviors associated with this function as described
 9   in sections 12.2.1 and 12.2.2. For either behavior, byte 131 is a two's complement 7-bit value (-128 to +127),
10   defining the decision threshold as a percentage of receiver eye amplitude given by the following equation:

19     12.2.1 RDT Behavior prior to and including Rev 12.4
20
21   In SFF-8472 revisions prior to Rev 12.4, Byte 130 is reserved and does not contain any information and Byte 131 is
22   only a control register and will not reflect the status of current value of RDT used. The module is expected to behave
23   as follows:
24
25       •    Module powers up with RDT value in Byte 131 = 0. (50%)
26       •    Variable RDT control mode is defined by the manufacturer may include:
27                o No or undefined active RDT control.
28                o RDT controlled as function of temperature as defined by the manufacturer.
29       •    A write to Byte 131 sets the RDT to the value set in Byte 131. This stops any active control of the RDT value
30            by the module. From this point RDT is in manual control mode.
31       •    Once in RDT manual mode, there is no means of reverting the RDT to automatic mode (or back to default
32            mode of the module). Only a power cycle will revert the module back to module’s default control mode.
33
35
36     12.2.2 RDT Behavior post Rev 12.4
37
38   RDT post revision 12.4 includes two advertisement bits in Byte 129 Table 12-2.
39      • Byte 129 Bit 0.
40              o If 0b, advertises that RDT mode behaves as prior to revision 12.4 of this document.
41              o If 1b, advertises that RDT mode behaves as described in this section.
42      • Byte 129 Bit 1. This is only applicable if Byte 129 Bit 0 is set to 1b.
43              o If 0b, advertises that the module does not return the current RDT value.
44              o If 1b, advertises that the module returns the current RDT value.
45
46   RDT post revision 12.4 includes a new control bit in Byte 130 bit 0. It also allows Byte 131 to return the current RDT
47   value, when the RDT mode is controlled automatically by the module.

 2               o 0b. RDT is in manual mode. The RDT value is defined by Byte 131 or a 2-wire write to Byte 131.
 3                  If this bit is written with 1b, the module will revert and take over the control of the RDT value.
 4               o 1b. RDT is in automatic mode. The RDT value is controlled by the module. Furthermore, if Byte
 5                  129 Bit 1 = 1b, the current RDT value used by the module will be reported in Byte 131. If Byte
 6                  129 Bit 1 = 0b, the current RDT value will not be reported in Byte 131 and the value of Byte 131

 8

 1   12.3 Remote Performance Monitoring (RPM)
 2
 3   Remote Performance Monitoring (RPM) is a method that allows a transceiver to be remotely managed over its media
 4   interface. The detail method is described in “MOPA Remote Monitoring Specifications v1.0”. Transceiver with
 5   hardware supporting RPM may use registers defined in this section and the additional data pages 20h to 27h defined
 6   in this document for the management of the remote transceiver. Transceivers at both ends of the link shall support
 7   RPM to enable RPM features.
 8
 9   A transceiver supporting RPM shall be able to transmit and receive digital messages using a low-speed low-modulation
10   signal modulated on top of the primary signal of the media interface. The signal characteristics of this modulated
11   signal is described in ITU-T G.698.4 with the exception that the transmitted signal is at 5 kbps @ 100,000 ppm
12   absolute accuracy, instead of 50 kbps @ 100 ppm. The choice of 5 kbps has been established to allow firmware only
13   encoding and decoding of RPM messages with minimal hardware support such as an FPGA. The choice of 100,000
14   ppm instead of 100 ppm is to eliminate the need of a precision clock and allow the use of the internal microcontroller
15   clock.
16
17   Other key features of this modulated signal relevant to this specification remain the same as defined in ITU-T G.698.4,
18   includes:
19        • A definition of a message frame consisting of a 48-bit frame starting with a 11-bit TOM (Type Of Message)
20           and a 24-bit MSG (Message Content) fields each with 5-bit and 8-bit hamming codes checksums respectively,
21           as shown in Figure 12-1. These hamming code checksums, positions and transmission bit-orders are detailed
22           in ITU-T G.698.4.
23        • Message frames are transmitted back-to-back continuously with no padding bits in between frames.
24        • Reception of the continuous bit-stream are sent to a “Framer” which will find the boundaries of the 48-bit
25           frame by comparing the checksums.
26        • The Framer declares Frame lock when 2 consecutive frame matches the expected checksum.
27        • The Framer declares Frame un-lock when 6 consecutive frames checksum are mismatched.

32   In a typical network, transceivers installed on HEE (Head-End Equipment) are connected over the media interface to
33   a transceiver installed on a TEE (Tail-End Equipment). Transceivers connected on TEE may benefit from being
34   managed remotely over the media interface, as the location of the TEE may be remote and hence more difficult to
35   be managed locally. In such a system, it is desirable to have the following features for a transceiver with RPM
36   capabilities.
37       • Symmetrical. Transceivers on either side of the media link behaves identically.
38       • Capability to transmit Remote Digital Diagnostics Monitoring (RDDM) over the media interface.
39       • Capability to transmits Inventory Data within 2s after link is establish.
40       • Capability to transmits Alarms and Warnings.
41       • RPM channel can be remotely enabled/disabled.
42       • Security features allowing which registers can be transmitted.
43       • Error counters to measure the quality of the RPM channel and calculate the error rates.
44
45   The method defined by MOPA and register defined here supports all the listed features above. This is achieved by
46   the specification of a transmitter and receiver state machine by “MOPA Remote Monitoring Specification” which
47   defines 5 new TOM (Type Of Message) codes to supplement G.698.4. These facilitates the exchange of data with
48   the remote transceiver with minimum host software intervention and essentially presents the memory map of the
49   remotely managed transceivers at the local transceiver in the data pages 20h to 27h. Section 12.4 briefly describes
50   the new TOM codes that is used by the RPM channel with more details described by the “MOPA Remote Monitoring
51   Specification”.

1    Remote Performance Registers are the contents of the entire memory map of SFF-8472 registers of the remote
2    transceiver mapped to the local transceiver at pages 20h to 27h (section 4.3). In addition to these pages, new
3    registers in A2h Page 02h as defined by Table 12-4 defines the additional memory map registers for controlling the
4    RPM feature. These registers are only applicable if the transceiver supports the RPM feature.

       240-     RW      RemotePM      When Byte 247 is written, this will trigger the Remote PM to transmit the
       247       8     TX User Data   data. This shall be sent at the highest priority and should interrupt the
                                      transmission of periodic data.


                                      Whilst the 8-bytes of data is transmitting, a Latched Alarm Bit will be
                                      raised. The host shall restrain writing to these set of registers as long as
                                      this alarm is raised.

                                      If any of the bytes 240-247 is written prior to all 8-bytes is transmitted, a
                                      Latched Alarm Bit indicating “overrun” may be raised, indicating that the
                                      transmit data corruption may have occurred or the new data is ignored.
                                      This depends on whether the module implements double buffering or not.

                                      The recommendation is for the module to not use double buffering of
                                      these 8 bytes and raise the “overrun” alarm if these bytes are written
                                      whilst the user channel is being transmitted. This is because since this
                                      message is a higher priority message, it will interrupt the regular
                                      transmission of periodic data and hence may affect the timing update
                                      performance of periodic data. Hence the host should refrain from sending
                                      user data more than once per second to allow regular digital diagnostics
                                      message to be transferred.

                                      There are no additional indication, no change in hardware pin states, to
                                      flag that the user data has been transmitted, beside the L-TX sending
                                      alarm.

       248–     RO      RemotePM      This set of 8 bytes will be updated if any of these bytes are received over
        255      8     RX User Data   the RPM channel.

                                      A latched alarm will be raised whenever the framer updates any of the
                                      I2C memory map location for bytes 248-255 in this page.

                                      In addition, whenever the RX User Data has been received, a latched
                                      alarm will be raised whenever the corresponding data byte that has been
                                      updated has a value that was changed by the RPM channel.

            2A0h       CTRL_CMD_RSP          This message controls the behavior of the remote transceiver. There are
                                             two types of control messages.
                      See section 12.4.1
                                             Type 0b. This is used to request the remote transceiver to send specific
                                             areas of the memory map.

                                             Type 1b. This is used to alter the memory map of the remote transceiver
                                             similar to an I2C write on the host interface.

            2A8h     SEND_A0_PG_DATA         This message is used to send memory map of page data to the remote
                                             transceiver. The SFF-8472 device address A0h lower and A0h upper
                      See section 12.4.2     memory map are sent using this TOM.

                                             This TOM is also used to send vendor pages.
            2A9h     SEND_A2_PG_DATA         This message is used to send memory map of A2h low (bytes 0-127) and
                                             A2h upper pages 0 and 2.

            2AAh          EXT_IDLE           This message is used by the state machine to send IDLE message. This
                                             is an extended IDLE message as the MSG field of this TOM consist of a
                                             running 24-bit counter. The transmitter will increment the counter each
                                             time a message has been sent.

                                             This message can also be used as a heartbeat.
            2ABh       SECURITY_IDLE         This message is sent instead of the requested data when a local security
                                             flag is set by the local host preventing memory map data to be sent over
                                             the media interface. When the receiver receives this message, a flag will
                                             be raised to indicate that the remote transceiver has prevented data to
                                             be sent due to security settings.

11   the remote host, including writing to the memory map of the remote transceiver (SFF-8472 based transceiver). A
12   command message that is sending commands shall be sent at a higher priority than other messages sending data

22   This message consists of:
23       • msgType is 0b.
24       • pgEnc (page Encoding) and pgDev (page Devices) indicates which page data to be transmitted, together
25          with the bytesToSendEnc mask field.

33              o pgDev 1 pgEnc 3. Resv. Could be potentially used to send A2h. Page 03h.
34       • repeatEnc defines how many times the page data shall be sent.
35              o Value of 0 mean to stop sending the data.
36              o Values between 1 to 6 is to tell the receiver to transmit data (in round robin) between 1 and 6 times
37                   and stop after sending the same data 1 to 6 times.
38              o Value of 7 mean that the data requested shall be sent repeatedly (RDDM data).
39       • bytesToSendEnc defines a 16-bit mask. Each bit defines an 8 byte group (octet) of addresses within the
40          page. The start address of the octet in the page = 8*bitpos. (Values are 0,8,16,…,112,120). This is a 7 bit
41          address, so this represent the lower 7 bits address in the upper I2C address space.

46   TOM 2A0h msgType 1b is to be used to command the receiver to write to a memory map location or take an action.
47   Upon reception of this message, the receiver shall send an acknowledgement back on the TX. This command and
48   acknowledge message will be sent as higher priority than data message. In order to ensure these command
49   messages are secure in an errored media channel, 3 frames of the command messages shall be sent. This will
50   protect against
51       • Error’ed frames that are being dropped.
52       • Error in frames that are not detected by the TOM and MSG checksums.
53       • Prevents incorrect memory address or action being taken.
54   The receiver should check to ensure that at least 2 frames of the same command is received back to back before

30   NOTE: This command allows any I2C memory of the remote transceiver in A2h Pages 00h/01h/02h to be written.
31   The only difference is the memory map is written from a command received in the media channel as opposed to the
32   local I2C interface. Currently it is up to the vendor’s firmware to accept or not accept these writes from the media
33   interface or only allow a certain set of registers to be writeable from the media interface.

33   This TOM is defined as a security IDLE message. It is mainly defined to signal to the receiver that due to local
34   security settings, the requested data cannot be sent, hence the data packet which is normally sent by using either
35   TOM of 2A8h or 2A9h has been replaced by this security IDLE message. The MSG payload consist of a 16-bit field
36   reserved for flags and an 8-bit sequence number.

2
3    Page 03h has been defined for parameters used for enhanced calibration for high accuracy timing. There are two
4    formats depending on the format identifier at the start of the page. The two formats are
5        • Calibration format for Optical Modules. See Table 13-1 and section 13.4
6        • Calibration format for Loopback Modules. See Table 13-2 and section 13.5
7
 8   Format ID (Bytes 128-129)
 9
10   Format ID determines if page 03h contains a valid entry. One of the following valid values determines the format of
11   the definition. The following formats are defined:
12
13       •     CA1Bh => 'CALB' Calibration format for Optical Modules (see section 13.4)
14       •     100Bh => 'LOOB' Calibration format for Loopback Modules (see section 13.5)

19   This check code is a one-byte code that can be used to verify that the 127 bytes of calibration configuration data
20   are correct. It uses byte 128 to 254 inclusive to calculate the check codes. This method is the same as the CC_*
21   check code computation in other tables in the document.
22
23
24   In the discovery of this page as mentioned in section 4.3, the host shall read and validate the format ID bytes 128-
25   129 as well as a checksum CC_CALIB to be as expected before the data of this page is used.

12   The delay calibration parameters stored in page 03h apply to delays between electrical and optical time reference
13   planes (also called phase planes). These reference planes are:
14       • Electrical reference plane: If connectors are used that specify their reference plane (like many RF
15           connectors) then that reference plane shall be used. Otherwise the electrical reference plane shall be the
16           landing spot of the contact finger.
17       • Optical reference plane: The fiber physical contact plane.
18   Manufacturers shall specify the reference planes that apply to the calibration of their modules.
19
20     13.1.1 Delays associated to Optical Modules
21
22   All Rx delays are from optical reference plane to electrical reference plane; all Tx delays are from electrical reference
23   plane to optical reference plane.
24   The module is characterized (in each direction) by two types of delays:
25        • Avg_Rx/Tx_LaneN: an average delay, and
26        • Delta_Rx/Tx_Max: a 3 sigma deviation from the average delay to take into account variations that can
27           occur between different units of the same module type and over the lifetime of the device, and calibration
28           inaccuracies.
29
30   IEEE1588 allows for the compensation of known delays and their asymmetries in the ingress and egress paths. The
31   average delay (Avg_Rx/Tx_LaneN) is used by the host of the module as input for this compensation. When a module
32   has multiple lanes, the host will select one of the lanes for sending the PTP messages. Therefore the host needs the
33   average delay value for each lane. The remaining unknown residual delay cannot be compensated for, but the value
34   of Delta_Rx/Tx_Max can be used to estimate the remaining inaccuracy of the module after compensation of the
35   average value. As the choice of the lane for PTP cannot be controlled outside the host, a single value (worst-case,
36   i.e. maximum over all its lanes) is sufficient per module. More details about the role of the host can be found in IEEE
37   802.3cx-2023.
38   The actual Receiver delay of a lane “N” (Rx_delay_LaneN) of the module (in a given operational mode) is statistically
39   bounded by the 3 sigma range;
40         13.1.1-(1)       Avg_Rx_LaneN – Delta_Rx_max  Rx_Delay_LaneN  Avg_Rx_LaneN + Delta_Rx_max
41   Similarly, the actual Transmitter delay of a lane “N” (Tx_Delay_LaneN) of the module (in a given operational mode)
42   is bounded by the 3 sigma range;

 4     13.1.2 Delays associated to Loopback Modules
 5
 6   A Calibration Loopback Module (Figure 13-1) provides calibrated access to the electrical reference plane (see 13.1)
 7   of the SFP/SFP+ connector to enable electrical absolute calibration of equipment that use optical modules.
 8
 9   The module is characterized by:
10      • Tx_to_Rx, Tx_to_Mon and Rx_to_Mon: average delays between the respective ports of the module, and
11      • Calibration Inaccuracy: largest value of the 3-sigma standard deviations of all reported delays.
12
13   Note: This method originates from H. Peek and P. Jansweijer, “White Rabbit Absolute Calibration.”
14

15   13.2 Numeric Formats
16
17   The calibration parameters in this page use numeric fixed-point arithmetic formats described in sections 13.2.1 to
18   13.2.4. The fixed-point arithmetic format notation used is: q<Number of bits for integer part>.< Number of bits for
19   fractional part >. The value in this format is obtained by multiplying the original value by 2< Number of bits for fractional part >.
20   For example 2.5 ns is expressed in q48.16 format as 0000 0000 0002 8000h.
21
22   NOTE: These numeric formats used for time are similar to the IEEE Std 1588 Time Interval data type (q48.16), which
23   is used to store ingress/ingress latencies, such that conversions and calculations are simple.
24
25     13.2.1 Description of the q16.16 format for time representation
26   Time in ns is represented by a fixed-point unsigned 32-bit integer in q16.16 format. The range of delays that can be
27   represented is from 0 to 65 s (216 ns) with a granularity of 15 fs (1/216 ns).
28
29     13.2.2 Description of the q8.16 format for time correction
30
31   Time correction in ns is represented by a fixed-point signed twos complement 24-bit integer in q8.16 format. The
32   range of delays that can be represented is [-128.0000 to +127.9999] ns with a granularity of 15 fs (1/216 ns).
33
34     13.2.3 Description of the q8.8 format for temperature
35
36   Temperature in degrees Celsius is represented by a fixed-point signed twos complement 16-bit integer in q8.8 format.
37   The range of temperature that can be represented is [-128 to +127] degrees with a granularity of 1/28 degrees Celsius.
38     13.2.4 Description of the q8.8 format for wavelength correction
39
40   Wavelength correction in 1/10th of a nm (0.1 nm) is represented by a fixed point signed twos complement 16-bit
41   integer in q8.8 format. The range of wavelength that can be represented is [-12.8 to 12.7] nm with a granularity of 0.4
42   pm (1/28 * 0.1 nm).

 2     13.3.4 Stratum (Byte 140)
 3
 4   This byte provides stratum value which indicates the length of the calibration chain, i.e. calibrator generation.
 5
 6   Calibration accuracy decreases with each calibrator generation. For example, an SFP calibration performed using
 7   proper equipment would render stratum n=0, such SFP can become a calibrator. An SFP calibration performed
 8   using a calibrator SFP with stratum n=0 would render SFP with stratum = 1 (next calibrator generation), such SFP
 9   can become a calibrator again, and so forth. The n-th generation has Stratum-n (0 being the highest accuracy).
10   When Stratum is unused or undefined this byte should be set to FFh.
11
12   NOTE: This value is informative, the inaccuracy of the provided calibration values is provided by calibration
13   inaccuracy bytes (see 13.1.1 and 13.1.2).

15   13.4 Calibration format for Optical Modules (Bytes 150-254)
16
17   Table 13-1 shows the summary of the register definitions when the Format ID is equal to CA1Bh (i.e., the
18   “Calibration format for Optical Modules” is used). The details of the registers are described in this section.
19     13.4.1 Nb_Lanes (Byte 150)
20
21   This unsigned integer value of 1 Byte indicates the number of lanes supported by the module. SFF 8472 supports a
22   single lane so this value is 1. This field is introduced for compatibility of Page 03h with multi-lane modules.
23     13.4.2 Op_Mode_Id (Byte 151)
24
25   This unsigned integer value of 1 Byte indicates the operational mode for which the set of delay values of page 03h
26   are valid.
27   An operational mode is a given combination of interface speed, DSP algorithms (eg FEC schemes), etc… Different
28   operational modes can lead to different delay values. The intention of this field is to identify the operational mode for
29   which the delay values in the page apply. The Id is an arbitrary number set by the module manufacturer. The host is
30   aware of the current operational mode of the module and needs to know the association to the corresponding Id, via
31   configuration. Note that the assumption is that all lanes operate in the same mode, so a single Op_Mode_Id reflects
32   the mode of all lanes.
33    The module shall support at least one mode and contain at least one page. The default value is 0, which indicates
34   that the module only has a single operational mode it can work in. This is the scope of this document. Modules with
35   multiple operational modes would have one Id value (different from 0) per mode and one associated page per mode.
36   This is out of scope of this document.

38     13.4.3 RX Power Dependent Delay (Bytes 152-166)

 1   And the input variable RX_PWR_dBm in equation 13.4.3-(1) is calculated using 13.4.3-(2).
 2
 3           13.4.3-(2) Rx_PWR_dBm = 10 * log10( Rx_PWR )
 4
 5   The input variable in equation 13.4.3-(2) is Rx_PWR (see sections 9.2, 9.3 item 5). It is read in 0.1 micro watt units
 6   and shall be converted into dBm units, Rx_PWR_dBm as per the 13.4.3-(2) equation, before being used in
 7   equation 13.4.3-(1) to calculate the output delay correction for Average Receiving delay (Avg_Rx_LaneN, see
 8   section13.1.1) in ns using q16.16 format (see section 13.2.2). The correction shall be applied as follows:
 9
10
11   13.4.3-(3) Avg_Rx_LaneN = Avg_Rx_LaneN + Rx_Pwr_Dly
12
13   When the Rx_Pwr_Dly(4-0) fields are not used then the bytes 152-166 shall be set to zero.
14
15     13.4.4 T_Detune_Offset (Bytes 167-168), T_Detune_Slope (Bytes 169-170)
16
17   These bytes provide T_Detune_Offset and T_Detune_Slope coefficients (see table 13-1) in equation 13.4.4-(1)
18   that defines temperature-dependent wavelength de-tuning with respect to the specified laser wavelength. When a
19   module has multiple lanes, it is expected that the lasers will have similar thermal behavior. Therefore the
20   characterization of a single laser is sufficient per module.
21
22   The input variable in equation13.4.4-(1) is the temperature in fixed point q8.8 format (see section 13.2.3 and
23   sections 9.2, 9.3 item 1). The output of the equation is the correction to the specified wavelength, expressed as a
24   fixed point q8.8 value (see section 13.2.4). This means that de-tuning can range from -12.8 nm up to 12.7 nm, from
25   the specified laser wavelength.
26
27
28       13.4.4-(1)                        T_Detune (0.1nm) = T_Detune_Slope * T(C) + T_Detune_Offset
29
30   When the T_Detune_Slope and T_Detune_Offset fields are not used then the bytes 167-170 shall be set to zero.
31
32     13.4.5 Delta_Rx_max (Bytes 171-174), Delta_Tx_Max (Bytes 175-178)
33
34   The residual delay is indicated in unsigned q16.16 format (see 13.2.1) in ns units. It represents the maximum over
35   all lanes (for SFF8472 the number of lanes is 1) of the 3-sigma deviations from the average delays in the respective
36   direction (receiving or transmitting). It is an unknown delay introduced by the device and holds for all reported delays.
37   When related to the average values in section 13.4.6 and 13.4.7, it can be used to classify the synchronization
38   inaccuracy performance of the device.
39
40   NOTE: The reported values shall take account of the inaccuracy of the calibration process and calibration
41   generation chain that is indicated by the stratum value, see 13.3.4.
42
43     13.4.6 Avg_Rx_LaneN with N=0 for SFF8472 (Bytes (179-182)+N*8)
44
45   The delay is indicated in unsigned q16.16 format (see 13.2.1) in ns units. It represents the average delay
46   characterized for the module in the Receiver direction of lane N. It is the known delay added by the device, and can
47   be compensated for by the host, e.g., for the purpose of synchronization using IEEE1588.
48   The register of unused or non-existing lanes is filled with 00h Bytes.
49
50     13.4.7 Avg_Tx_LaneN with N=0 for SFF8472 (Bytes (183-186)+N*8)

52   The delay is indicated in unsigned q16.16 format (see 13.2.1) in ns units. It represents the average delay
53   characterized for the module in the Transmitter direction of lane N. It is the known delay added by the device, and
54   can be compensated for by the host, e.g., for the purpose of synchronization using IEEE1588.
55   The register of unused or non-existing lanes is filled with 00h Bytes.

 1   13.5 Calibration format for Loopback Modules (Bytes 150-254)
 2
 3   Table 13-2 shows the summary of the register definitions when the Format ID (see 13) is equal to 100Bh (i.e., the
 4   “Calibration format for Loopback Modules” is used). The details of the registers are described in this section.
 5
 6   The Calibration Loopback module connects the TX and RX ports on the electrical SFP connector and probes this
 7   electrical loopback connection while forwarding the probed signals with fixed and calibrated delay to the monitor
 8   connector (see Figure 13-1). This allows for calibrated access of the electric time reference plane of SFP/SFP+
 9   sockets of network devices. The calibrated delays between TX, RX and MON are provided in the bytes defined
10   below.

16     13.5.1 Calibration Inaccuracy (Bytes 150-153)
17
18   The value represents the calibration inaccuracy of the reported delays. It is a 4 byte value in unsigned q16.16 format
19   (see section 13.2.1) in ns units.
20
21   NOTE: The reported values shall take account of the inaccuracy of the calibration process and calibration
22   generation chain that is indicated by the stratum value, see 13.3.4.
23
24     13.5.2 TX to RX Delay (Bytes 155-158)
25
26   Tx-to-Rx Delay is the fixed delay from TX to RX port in ns using q16.16 format (see section 13.2.1).
27
28     13.5.3 TX to MON Delay (Bytes 160-163)
29
30   Tx-to-Mon Delay is the fixed delay from TX to the output connectors in ns using q16.16 format (see section 13.2.1).
31
32     13.5.4 RX to MON Delay (Bytes 165-168)
33
34   Rx-to-Mon Delay is the fixed delay from RX to the output connectors in ns using q16.16 format (see section 13.2.1).
