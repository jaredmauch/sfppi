If you are not a member of the SFF Committee, but you are interested in
participating, the following principles have been reprinted here for your
information.

                     PRINCIPLES OF THE SFF COMMITTEE

The SFF Committee is an ad hoc group formed to address storage industry needs in
a prompt manner. When formed in 1990, the original goals were limited to defining
de facto mechanical envelopes within which disk drives can be developed to fit
compact computer and other small products.

Adopting a common industry size simplifies the integration of small drives (2
1/2" or less) into such systems. Board-board connectors carrying power and
signals, and their position relative to the envelope are critical parameters in a
product that has no cables to provide packaging leeway for the integrator.

In November 1992, the SFF Committee objectives were broadened to encompass other
areas which needed similar attention, such as pinouts for interface applications,
and form factor issues on larger disk drives. SFF is a forum for resolving
industry issues that are either not addressed by the standards process or need an
immediate solution.

Documents created by the SFF Committee are expected to be submitted to bodies
such as EIA (Electronic Industries Association) or an ASC (Accredited Standards
Committee). They may be accepted for separate standards, or incorporated into
other standards activities.

The principles of operation for the SFF Committee are not unlike those of an
accredited standards committee. There are 3 levels of participation:

- Attending the meetings is open to all, but taking part in discussions is
  limited to member companies, or those invited by member companies
- The minutes and copies of material which are discussed during meetings
  are distributed only to those who sign up to receive documentation.
- The individuals who represent member companies of the SFF Committee
  receive documentation and vote on issues that arise. Votes are not taken
  during meetings, only guidance on directions. All voting is by letter
  ballot, which ensures all members an equal opportunity to be heard.

Material presented at SFF Committee meetings becomes public domain. There are no
restrictions on the open mailing of material presented at committee meetings. In
order to reduce disagreements and misunderstandings, copies must be provided for
all agenda items that are discussed. Copies of the material presented, or
revisions if completed in time, are included in the documentation mailings.

The sites for SFF Committee meetings rotate based on which member companies
volunteer to host the meetings. Meetings have typically been held during the ASC
T10 weeks.

The funds received from the annual membership fees are placed in escrow, and are
used to reimburse ENDL for the services to manage the SFF Committee.

A2. Mating of SFP Transceiver PCB to SFP Electrical Connector
The SFP transceiver contains a printed circuit board that mates with the SFP electrical
connector. The pads are designed for a sequenced mating:
              •   First mate – ground contacts
              •   Second mate – power contacts
              •   Third mate – signal contacts

The design of the mating portion of the transceiver printed circuit board is illustrated in Figure 2
and the electrical pad layout is illustrated in Figure 3. A typical contact pad plating for the
printed circuit board is 0.38 micrometers minimum hard gold over 1.27 micrometers minimum
thick nickel. Other plating options that meet the performance requirements are acceptable.

A5. Labeling of SFP Transceivers
Color coding requirements for optical SFP transceivers are specified in Figure 1B.
Each SFP transceiver should be clearly labeled. The complete labeling need not be visible
when the SFP transceiver is installed. Labeling should include appropriate manufacturing and
part number identification, appropriate regulatory compliance labeling, and a clear specification
of the external port characteristics. The external port characteristic label may include such
information as optical wavelength, required fiber characteristics, operating data rate, interface
standards supported, and link length supported.

A6. Bezel Design for Systems Using SFP Transceivers

Host enclosures that use SFP devices should provide appropriate clearances between the
SFP transceivers to allow insertion and extraction without the use of special tools and a bezel
enclosure with sufficient mechanical strength. For most systems a nominal centerline to
centerline spacing of 16.25mm (0.640”) is sufficient. See Figure 5 for the recommended bezel
design. For double-sided board mounting, a printed circuit board thickness of 3.0mm (0.118”)
is required.
The SFP transceiver insertion slot should be clear of nearby moldings and covers that might
block convenient access to the latching mechanisms, the SFP transceiver, or the cables
connected to the SFP transceiver.

A9.     Dust / EMI Cover
The order to prevent contamination of the internal components and to optimize EMI
performance, it is recommended that a Dust/EMI Plug be inserted into cage assemblies when
no transceiver is present. The maximum dimensions of the Dust/EMI Cover are listed in Table
4 and the maximum size is illustrated in Figure 7A. The Dust/EMI Cover shall exert a
maximum force of 4.0 Newtons per side to the inside surfaces of the cage. This force shall be
measured as the force/side required to compress the Dust/EMI Cover’s compliant feature(s) to
the maximum dimensions listed in Table 4 (Illustrated in Figure 7A).

B1.    Introduction
This annex contains pin definition data for the small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceiver.
The pin definition data is specific to gigabit rate datacom applications such as Fibre Channel
and Gigabit Ethernet. It is expected that different pin definitions will be developed for
SONET/ATM and lower data rate datacom applications.

B2.    Pin Definitions
Figure 1 below shows the pin names and numbering for the connector block on the host board.
The diagram is in the same relative orientation as the host board layout (see Appendix A,
Figure 4.). As mentioned, this pinout only applies to gigabit rate datacom applications. The
pin functions are defined in Table 1 and the accompanying notes. Figure 2A shows the
recommended power supply filtering network. Figure 2B shows an example of a complete
SFP host board schematic with connections to SerDes and protocol ICs. For EMI protection
the signals to the 20-pin connector should be shut off when the transceiver is removed.
Standard board layout practices such as connections to Vcc and GND with Vias, use of short-
and equal-length differential signal lines, use of microstrip-lines and 50Ω terminations are
recommended. Chassis grounds and external electromagnetic interference shields should not
be attached to circuit ground.

Plug Seq.: Pin engagement sequence during hot plugging.
1) TX Fault is an open collector/drain output, which should be pulled up with a 4.7K – 10KΩ
   resistor on the host board. Pull up voltage between 2.0V and VccT, R+0.3V. When high,
   output indicates a laser fault of some kind. Low indicates normal operation. In the low
   state, the output will be pulled to < 0.8V.

2) TX disable is an input that is used to shut down the transmitter optical output. It is pulled
   up within the module with a 4.7 – 10 KΩ resistor. Its states are:
   Low (0 – 0.8V):          Transmitter on
   (>0.8, < 2.0V):          Undefined
   High (2.0 – 3.465V):     Transmitter Disabled
   Open:                    Transmitter Disabled

                                    Table 1 Notes (Cont.)
3) Mod-Def 0,1,2. These are the module definition pins. They should be pulled up with a
   4.7K – 10KΩ resistor on the host board. The pull-up voltage shall be VccT or VccR (see
   Section IV for further details).

   Mod-Def 0 is grounded by the module to indicate that the module is present
   Mod-Def 1 is the clock line of two wire serial interface for serial ID
   Mod-Def 2 is the data line of two wire serial interface for serial ID

4) This is an optional input used to control the receiver bandwidth for compatibility with
   multiple data rates (most likely Fibre Channel 1x and 2x Rates). If implemented, the input
   will be internally pulled down with > 30kΩ resistor. The input states are:

   Low (0 – 0.8V):          Reduced Bandwidth
   (>0.8 , < 2.0V):         Undefined
   High (2.0 – 3.465V):     Full Bandwidth
   Open:                    Reduced Bandwidth
5) LOS (Loss of Signal) is an open collector/drain output, which should be pulled up with a
   4.7K – 10KΩ resistor. Pull up voltage between 2.0V and VccT, R+0.3V. When high, this
   output indicates the received optical power is below the worst-case receiver sensitivity (as
   defined by the standard in use). Low indicates normal operation. In the low state, the
   output will be pulled to < 0.8V.
6) VeeR and VeeT may be internally connected within the SFP module.

7) RD-/+: These are the differential receiver outputs. They are AC coupled 100 Ω differential
   lines which should be terminated with 100 Ω (differential) at the user SERDES. The AC
   coupling is done inside the module and is thus not required on the host board. The voltage
   swing on these lines will be between 370 and 2000 mV differential (185 – 1000 mV single
   ended) when properly terminated.

8) VccR and VccT are the receiver and transmitter power supplies. They are defined as 3.3V
   ±5% at the SFP connector pin. Maximum supply current is 300 mA. Recommended host
   board power supply filtering is shown below. Inductors with DC resistance of less than
   1Ω=should be used in order to maintain the required voltage at the SFP input pin with 3.3V
   supply voltage. When the recommended supply filtering network is used, hot plugging of
   the SFP transceiver module will result in an inrush current of no more than 30 mA greater
   than the steady state value. VccR and VccT may be internally connected within the SFP
   transceiver module.

9) TD-/+: These are the differential transmitter inputs. They are AC-coupled, differential lines
   with 100Ω differential termination inside the module. The AC coupling is done inside the
   module and is thus not required on the host board. The inputs will accept differential
   swings of 500 – 2400 mV (250 – 1200 mV single-ended), though it is recommended that
   values between 500 and 1200 mV differential (250 – 600 mV single-ended) be used for
   best EMI performance.

During power on of the SFP transceiver, TX_FAULT, if implemented, may be asserted (High)
as soon as power supply voltages are within specification. For transceiver initialization with
TX_DISABLE negated, TX_FAULT shall be negated when the transmitter safety circuitry, if
implemented, has detected that the transmitter is operating in its normal state. If a transmitter
fault has not occurred, TX_FAULT shall be negated within a period t_init from the time that
VCCT exceeds the specified minimum operating voltage (see Table 2). If TX_FAULT remains
asserted beyond the period t_init, the host may assume that a transmission fault has been
detected by the transceiver.

For SFP transceiver power on initialization with TX_DISABLE asserted, the state of

TX_FAULT may be asserted while safety circuit initialization is performed. TX_FAULT shall be
negated when the transmitter safety circuitry, if implemented, has detected that the transmitter
is operating in its normal state. If a transmitter fault has not occurred, TX_FAULT shall be
negated within a period t_init from the time that TX_DISABLE is negated. If TX_FAULT
remains asserted beyond the period t_init, the host may assume that a transmission fault has
been detected by the transceiver.
If no transmitter safety circuitry is implemented, the TX_FAULT signal may be tied to its

asserted is shown in Figure 4.

voltage, and signal contacts in the specified order. After the SFP has determined that VCCT has
reached the specified value, the power on initialization takes place as described in the above
sections. An example of initialization during hot plugging is provided in Figure 5.

The detection of a safety-related transmitter fault condition presented by TX_FAULT shall be
latched. The following protocol may be used to reset the latch in case the transmitter fault
condition is transient. To reset the fault condition and associated detection circuitry,
TX_DISABLE shall be asserted for a minimum of t_reset. TX_DISABLE shall then be negated.
In less than the maximum value of t_init the optical transmitter will correctly reinitialize the laser
circuits, negate TX_FAULT, and begin normal operation if the fault condition is no longer
present. If a fault condition is detected during the reinitialization, TX_FAULT shall again be
asserted, the fault condition again latched, and the optical transmitter circuitry will again be
disabled until the next time a reset protocol is attempted. The manufacturer of the SFP shall
ensure that the optical power emitted from an open connector or fiber is compliant with
IEC825-1 and CDRH during all reset attempts, during normal operation or upon the occurrence

SFP transceiver loss of signal indication
The LOS signal is intended as a preliminary indication to the system in which the SFP
transceiver is installed that the link signals are likely to be outside the required values for
proper operation. Such indications typically point to non-installed cables, broken cables, or a
disabled, failing or powered off transmitter at the far end of the cable. Additional indications are
provided by the system in which the SFP transceiver is installed to verify that the information
being transmitted is valid, correctly encoded, and in the correct format. Such additional
indications are outside the scope of the SFP TRANSCEIVER MSA.
The timing of the LOS function is specified in Figure 10.

B4.    Module Definition Interface and Data Field Description
The definition of the MOD-DEF function is drawn largely from the GBIC standard with some
small, but backwards compatible, changes to the fields or allowed values to reflect the latest
standards and expectations for these transceivers. In some cases, this backward compatibility
approach results in the possibility of illegal combinations (such as defining an SFP module with
SC optical connectors). Some locations previously reserved in the GBIC serial identification
have now been defined.

It should be noted that only the serial module definition and the basic Mod-Def 0 indication of
module present are implemented. The use of MOD DEF lines as static codes for module
definition as done with GBIC are not implemented.
Overview

The SFP serial ID provides access to sophisticated identification information that describes the
transceiver’s capabilities, standard interfaces, manufacturer, and other information. The serial
interface uses the 2-wire serial CMOS E2PROM protocol defined for the ATMEL
AT24C01A/02/04 family of components.
When the serial protocol is activated, the host generates the serial clock signal (SCL, Mod Def
1). The positive edge clocks data into those segments of the E2PROM that are not write-
protected within the SFP transceiver. The negative edge clocks data from the SFP
transceiver.
The serial data signal (SDA, Mod Def 2) is bi-directional for serial data transfer. The host uses
SDA in conjunction with SCL to mark the start and end of serial protocol activation. The
memories are organized as a series of 8-bit data words that can be addressed individually or
sequentially.
This section defines the information structures that are obtained from the SFP transceiver via
the serial ID.
A SFP transceiver shall meet the electrical and optical requirements, including amplitude, eye
diagram, jitter, and other parameters, specified for the standards with which the transceiver
claims compliance.

Serial information definition

The 2-wire serial CMOS E2PROM provides sequential or random access to 8 bit parameters,
addressed from 0000h to the maximum address of the memory. The address select pins for
the serial CMOS E2PROM shall be set to zero (fixed at the VIL low level). The fields specified
by this section shall not be written by the host in which it is installed. The SFP transceiver may
enforce this by using the write protect features of the CMOS E2PROM.

Serial information definition (Cont.)

The word address is transmitted with the high order bit transmitted first. The protocol for the 2-
wire serial interface sequentially transmits one or more 8-bit bytes, with the data byte
addressed by the lowest word address transmitted first. In each data byte, the high order bit
(bit 7 in the accompanying tables) is transmitted first.
Numeric fields are expressed in binary, with the high order byte being transferred first and the
high order bit of each byte being transferred first. Numeric fields are padded on the left with
binary zero values.
Character strings are ordered with the first character to be displayed located in the lowest word
address of the string. Each character shall be coded as a US-ASCII character as defined by
ISO 8859-1, with the high order bit transmitted first. All character strings will be padded on the
right with ASCII spaces (20h) to fill empty bytes.
All bits of reserved fields shall be set to zero until future definitions require their use.
A minimum of 96 bytes shall be readable by the serial identification process.
The maximum clock rate of the serial interface shall be 100 KHz.
The following tables define the contents of the serial CMOS E2PROM. The first table is a
summary of all the data fields in the serial ID chip. The remaining tables contain detailed
descriptions of the individual data fields.
